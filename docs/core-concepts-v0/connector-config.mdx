    ### Example: Google Docs (OAuth2 Connector)

    To configure Google Docs as a connector, you must set up OAuth2 credentials in Google Cloud. Follow these general steps (modeled after the [standard Google OAuth setup process](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html)):

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a Google Cloud Project">
        Go to the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Console</a> and create (or select) your project.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enable the Google Docs API">
        On the left menu, click <b>APIs & Services ‚Üí Library</b>. Search for "Google Docs API" and click <b>Enable</b>.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure OAuth consent screen">
        Go to <b>APIs & Services ‚Üí OAuth consent screen</b>. Fill in required information (app name, support email, developer contact info, and add test users as needed).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create OAuth client ID">
        Under <b>APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials</b>, click <b>Create Credentials ‚Üí OAuth client ID</b>.
        <ul>
          <li>Select <b>Web application</b>.</li>
          <li>Set an appropriate name (such as <b>OpenInt Google Docs Integration</b>).</li>
          <li>Add your callback URI in Authorized redirect URIs (e.g. <code>https://your-app-domain.com/api/openint/oauth/callback/google-docs</code>‚Äîadjust for your deployment domain).</li>
        </ul>
        Save and note the <b>Client ID</b> and <b>Client Secret</b>.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure Scopes">
        Add the scopes required by your workflow. See the <a href="https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth">Google Docs OAuth Scopes documentation</a>. Example minimum scope:
        <CodeBlock>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly</CodeBlock>
        Grant only the least privilege your use case requires.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enter Credentials in OpenInt">
        In the OpenInt dashboard‚Äôs Connector Configs, choose Google Docs and enter the Client ID, Client Secret, and scopes from above. Save.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify Connector & Test the Flow">
        Google Docs should now appear as available. Test with the Magic Link or Connect UI to complete OAuth and ensure correct permissions.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

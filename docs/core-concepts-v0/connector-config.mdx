# üîå Configure a Connector

Step-by-step guide to configure a connector in OpenInt.

## What is a Connector?

A connector in OpenInt is a bridge that allows you to integrate with various external services. It simplifies the process of connecting your app to third-party APIs, enabling seamless data exchange and management.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Configure a Connector

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up or Log In">
    Access your [app dashboard](https://app.openint.dev/dashboard/sign-up) to
    get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Connector Configs">
    Go to Connector Configs in the sidebar.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure a Connector">
    Set up the desired connector for your integration. For this example we will
    setup Greenhouse, fill in the required fields and click on **Create**.

    ### Example: Google Docs Connector
    
    If you wish to add support for Google Docs, here's an example of how your configuration might look. Note that unlike most connectors, the Google Docs integration currently only supports the non-standard `documents.currentonly` scope:
    
    ```json title="Google Docs Connector Config"
    {
      "provider": "google-docs",
      "client_id": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
      "client_secret": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET",
      "redirect_uri": "https://app.openint.dev/oauth/callback",
      "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly"]
    }
    ```
    
    - See full integration details and setup steps in the [Google Docs Integration Guide](/integrations/google-docs).
    - For supported scopes and why full document/drive access is not yet available, see [Supported OAuth Scopes](/integrations/google-docs#step-2-supported-oauth-scopes).
    
    <Callout type="warning">
    Not all OpenInt connectors support the full suite of permissions or OAuth scopes offered by their underlying service. For instance, Google Docs currently supports only per-document access (`documents.currentonly`). Always consult the [integration's documentation](/integrations) for details.
    </Callout>
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connector">
    You should see the new connector in the available connectors table.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/saved-connector.png" alt="Connector Table" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ready to Connect!">
    You are now ready to connect to your Greenhouse account (or any other) using [Magic Links](/core-concepts/magic-link).
  </Step>
</Steps>

# üîå Configure a Connector

Step-by-step guide to configure a connector in OpenInt.

## What is a Connector?

A connector in OpenInt is a bridge that allows you to integrate with various external services. It simplifies the process of connecting your app to third-party APIs, enabling seamless data exchange and management.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Configure a Connector

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up or Log In">
    Access your [app dashboard](https://app.openint.dev/dashboard/sign-up) to
    get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Connector Configs">
    Go to Connector Configs in the sidebar.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure a Connector">
    Set up the desired connector for your integration. For this example we will
    setup Greenhouse, fill in the required fields and click on **Create**.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/connector-form.png" alt="Connector Form" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connector">
    You should see the new connector in the available connectors table.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/saved-connector.png" alt="Connector Table" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ready to Connect!">
    You are now ready to connect to your Greenhouse account using a [Magic
    Links](/core-concepts/magic-link).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Configuring the Google Docs Connector

Integrating Google Docs with OpenInt requires additional setup steps due to OAuth and required scopes. Here is a step-by-step guide for developers, modeled after common Google API setup workflows. For background, see [Google's documentation on OAuth scopes for the Docs API](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth).

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Project
- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Click **Select a project** > **New Project**. Enter a project name and click **Create**.

### 2. Enable the Google Docs API
- With your project selected, navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
- Search for "Google Docs API" and click it.
- Click **Enable**.

### 3. Create OAuth Credentials
- Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
- Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** > **OAuth client ID**.
- If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen (set a product name, support email, and add your app domain if required).
- Choose **Web application** as the application type.
- Set an appropriate name (e.g., "OpenInt Docs Integration").
- Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the OpenInt OAuth redirect URI (provided in your OpenInt dashboard or integration setup panel). Example:
   - `https://api.openint.dev/oauth/callback` (replace as needed)
- Click **Create**.
- Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** generated.

### 4. Set Required OAuth Scopes
Google Docs API access requires one or more OAuth scopes. For a full list and their descriptions, see [the Google Docs API scopes reference](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth).

**Example scopes:**
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly` *(read-only access to documents)*
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` *(read/write access to documents‚Äîuse only if strictly necessary)*

> Only request the minimum scopes required for your use case to comply with Google‚Äôs best practices and ensure user trust.

### 5. Configure the Connector in OpenInt
- In the OpenInt dashboard, navigate to **Connector Configs**.
- Choose **Google Docs** from the list.
- Enter your Google OAuth **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from earlier steps.
- Specify the OAuth scopes you need (either paste or select from those mentioned above).
- Save the configuration.

### 6. Test the Integration
- From your app, launch the OpenInt flow for Google Docs.
- Authenticate with a Google account and ensure you are prompted for the correct scopes.
- Upon success, you should see the relevant integration available and can confirm that API calls for the scopes you granted succeed.

# üîå Configure a Connector

Step-by-step guide to configure a connector in OpenInt.

## What is a Connector?

A connector in OpenInt is a bridge that allows you to integrate with various external services. It simplifies the process of connecting your app to third-party APIs, enabling seamless data exchange and management.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Configure a Connector

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up or Log In">
    Access your [app dashboard](https://app.openint.dev/dashboard/sign-up) to
    get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Connector Configs">
    Go to Connector Configs in the sidebar.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure a Connector">
    Set up the desired connector for your integration. For this example we will
    setup Greenhouse, fill in the required fields and click on **Create**.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/connector-form.png" alt="Connector Form" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connector">
    You should see the new connector in the available connectors table.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/saved-connector.png" alt="Connector Table" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ready to Connect!">
    You are now ready to connect to your Greenhouse account using a [Magic
    Link](/core-concepts/magic-link).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connector-Specific Settings & OAuth Scopes

Some connectors (especially cloud document providers, like **Google Docs**) require additional configuration for OAuth 2.0 and the definition of required API scopes when connecting accounts. For example, to integrate with **Google Docs**, you must:

- Create OAuth credentials in your Google Cloud Project.
- Specify the OAuth scopes your use case requires (see the [full guide](/integrations/google-docs) for detailed instructions).

Consult each provider's integration guide for full instructions on required credentials, permitted scopes, and testing procedures.

> For a step-by-step Google Docs configuration walkthrough, see our [Google Docs Integration Guide](/integrations/google-docs).

# üîå Configure a Connector

Step-by-step guide to configure a connector in OpenInt.

## What is a Connector?

A connector in OpenInt is a bridge that allows you to integrate with various external services. It simplifies the process of connecting your app to third-party APIs, enabling seamless data exchange and management.

<strong>Special note for Google Docs integrations:</strong> OpenInt's Google Docs connector currently supports only the limited/unofficial <code>documents.currentonly</code> OAuth scope, giving access only to the document presently open during the auth flow (typical for Docs add-ons). It does NOT provide general account-wide Docs/Drive access like other OAuth connectors. For more details, setup walkthrough, and the full list of supported/unsupported scopes, see the <a href="/integrations/google-docs">Google Docs developer integration guide</a>.

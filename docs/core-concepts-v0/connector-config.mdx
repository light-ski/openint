# üîå Configure a Connector

Step-by-step guide to configure a connector in OpenInt.

## What is a Connector?

A connector in OpenInt is a bridge that allows you to integrate with various external services. It simplifies the process of connecting your app to third-party APIs, enabling seamless data exchange and management.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Configure a Connector

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up or Log In">
    Access your [app dashboard](https://app.openint.dev/dashboard/sign-up) to
    get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Connector Configs">
    Go to Connector Configs in the sidebar.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure a Connector">
    Set up the desired connector for your integration. For this example we will
    setup Greenhouse, fill in the required fields and click on **Create**.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/connector-form.png" alt="Connector Form" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connector">
    You should see the new connector in the available connectors table.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/saved-connector.png" alt="Connector Table" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ready to Connect!">
    You are now ready to connect to your Greenhouse account using a [Magic
    Links](/core-concepts/magic-link).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## ‚ö° Google Docs Connector: OAuth Configuration Guide

Setting up the Google Docs connector in OpenInt requires a valid Google OAuth 2.0 Client and appropriate scopes. This step-by-step guide follows the style of trusted integration guides, ensuring a smooth setup process.

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Project

- Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Click **Select project** > **New Project**. Enter a name (e.g., `OpenInt Integrations`) and click **Create**.

### 2. Enable the Google Docs API

- With your project selected, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
- Search for "Google Docs API" and click **Enable**.

### 3. Configure OAuth Consent Screen

- In the side menu, open **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
- Set the user type (usually "External").
- Enter an app name, support email, and authorized domain (e.g., `openint.dev`).
- Fill in required fields and save.

> **Do not click ‚ÄúPublish App‚Äù or go through sensitive scope verification unless you require Google verification for production.**

### 4. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

- Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
- Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.
- Choose "Web application", name it (e.g., `OpenInt Docs Connector`).
- Set authorized redirect URIs:
  - Get the correct URI from your OpenInt dashboard, e.g.
    - `https://app.openint.dev/oauth/callback`
    - (Or your own deployment URI for self-hosted OpenInt)
- Click **Create** and save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### 5. Set Required OAuth Scopes

Google Docs integrations require explicit permission via OAuth scopes. For most OpenInt use cases, these are the most relevant scopes ([full reference](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth#docs-scopes)):

| Scope                                                   | Description                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`    | Read Google Docs                             |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`             | Full read/write access to Google Docs        |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`            | Access to files created or opened by the app |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`        | Read files in user's Drive                   |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`                 | Full Drive access (USE WITH CAUTION)         |

Use the minimum scopes needed; prefer `documents.readonly` and `drive.file` for maximum privacy and security.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Some scopes (such as `drive` or `documents`) are considered sensitive/restricted and may require Google app verification and/or security review to access in production. [Google‚Äôs scope policy](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13461325)

### 6. Configure the Connector in OpenInt

- In your OpenInt dashboard, create or edit a connector for Google Docs.
- Enter the following information in the configuration form:
  - **Client ID** (from Google Cloud OAuth credentials)
  - **Client Secret** (from Google Cloud OAuth credentials)
  - **Scopes** (comma-separated list; see above for recommended options)
  - **Redirect URI** (must match your credentials and OpenInt instance)
- Click **Create** (or **Update**) to save the connector.

### 7. Connect Accounts and Test

- Trigger authentication using your app‚Äôs Connect flow or Magic Link.
- Go through the Google consent screen and approve requested scopes.
- Upon successful connection, OpenInt can access docs and files within the permissions you allowed.

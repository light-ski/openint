# HubSpot Integration (Developer Guide)

Integrate HubSpot seamlessly into your app using OpenIntâ€™s white-label integration engine. This guide walks through every step needed to enable your users to securely connect their HubSpot accounts, set up OAuth, and utilize granular CRM accessâ€”minimizing your engineering overhead.

---

## Overview

The OpenInt HubSpot connector is designed for applications in the CRM and ticketing verticals. It uses HubSpotâ€™s public OAuth 2.0 APIs to let your users authenticate and authorize access to their HubSpot data. The integration currently supports read-only access to CRM contact objects; more scopes and features will be enabled in future releases.

---

## Quickstart

These instructions guide you through setting up HubSpot OAuth, configuring OpenInt, and embedding HubSpot account linking within your app.

### 1. Register a HubSpot App

1. **Sign up or log in** to a [HubSpot developer account](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers).
2. Navigate to **Apps** in your developer account, then click **Create app**.
3. Enter your appâ€™s name, description, and other details. These will be visible to users during authentication.
4. Go to the **Auth** tab. Here youâ€™ll find your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** after saving your app.
    - More detailed, official instructions: [HubSpot Docs: Public apps](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/public-apps/overview)

### 2. Configure OAuth Settings

- **Redirect URIs:** Add your production and development redirect URLs under the app's **Auth** tab.
    - For local testing, you can use `http://localhost`.
- **Scopes:** Use the scope picker to add the relevant OAuth scopes required for your OpenInt integration (see [Supported Scopes](#supported-scopes) below).

### 3. Input Credentials into OpenInt

In your OpenInt dashboard or secrets/config, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from HubSpot and set them for the HubSpot connector. Example config:

```json
{
  "provider": "hubspot",
  "client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
  "client_secret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
  "redirect_uri": "https://yourapp.com/api/openint/callback/hubspot",
  "scopes": ["crm.objects.contacts.read"]
}
```

### 4. Test the Integration

With your app and OpenInt configured, trigger the HubSpot connect flow in your application. Your users will be prompted to log in to HubSpot, review requested scopes, and authorize access.

## OAuth & Scopes in HubSpot

HubSpot OAuth 2.0 grants your app secure, delegated access to users' data. All HubSpot integrations **must** request at least the required OAuth scopes. Each scope enables access to a specific set of API capabilities.

You can review the full official list and details at:
- [HubSpot OAuth scopes documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/authentication/working-with-oauth#configure-scopes)

### Supported Scopes

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

**1. Invalid redirect URI**
  - Ensure the redirect URI registered in your HubSpot app **exactly matches** the URI provided to OpenInt. HubSpot is strict; even minor differences (e.g., trailing slash) will cause errors.

**2. Missing or excess scopes**
  - Only request the scopes you need. Missing required scopes or requesting scopes not yet supported by your OpenInt plan may lead to "invalid scope" errors.

**3. Incorrect client secret**
  - Verify that you are using the correct, current secretâ€”these can be regenerated in your HubSpot app dashboard if ever leaked or rotated.

**4. Testing with developer accounts**
  - HubSpot apps cannot be installed on developer accounts. Always create a [HubSpot test account](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/getting-started/account-types) for test installs.

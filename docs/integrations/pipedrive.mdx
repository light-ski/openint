# Pipedrive Integration

> This guide describes how to set up and embed the Pipedrive integration in your app using OpenInt. It explains how to register a Pipedrive OAuth2 application, configure OpenInt, manage required scopes, and address common implementation issues.

## Quickstart: Embedding Pipedrive with OpenInt

1. **Create a Pipedrive Developer Account**  
   If you don't already have a [Pipedrive developer sandbox account](https://developers.pipedrive.com/), sign up.
2. **Register Your OAuth App in Pipedrive**  
   In your Pipedrive sandbox account, access **Developer Hub** (Settings → Company Name → Developer Hub).
   Click "Create an app" → "Create public app".
   Fill in **App Name** and your desired **OAuth Callback URL** (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/callback`).
   Save to proceed to the "OAuth & access scopes" tab, where you can copy your `client_id` and `client_secret`.
   [Step-by-step instructions](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-registering-the-app)
3. **Select the Required OAuth Scopes**  
   Choose only the scopes your application requires. See the [full scopes list and descriptions](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations) for guidance.  
   OpenInt currently supports a subset of Pipedrive scopes—see table below.
4. **Configure OAuth Credentials in OpenInt**  
   In your OpenInt admin/configuration, add the obtained `client_id` and `client_secret`.
   Set the authorization and token endpoints as follows:
     - Authorization URL: `https://oauth.pipedrive.com/oauth/authorize`
     - Token URL: `https://oauth.pipedrive.com/oauth/token`
5. **Configure the API Domain**  
   Pipedrive requires specifying the API domain. Example config in OpenInt:

   ```json
   {
     "api_domain": "https://yourcompany.pipedrive.com"
   }
   ```
   The value must match your Pipedrive subdomain.
6. **Test and Complete the OAuth Flow**  
   Initiate a connection from your app—OpenInt will redirect users to Pipedrive for consent.  
   After approval, OpenInt will obtain access tokens.

## Supported and Available Pipedrive OAuth Scopes

OpenInt supports the following Pipedrive OAuth scopes. For each scope, hover for a description. For the full upstream reference, visit the [official scopes documentation](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations).

| Scope           | Description                                                                                                    | Supported by OpenInt? |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------:|
| base            | <Tooltip tip="Provides access to basic user information such as name, email, and company details. Does not include access to any deal, person, or organization data.">Basic user info</Tooltip>                                | ✅                  |
| contacts:read   | <Tooltip tip="Allows read-only access to contacts (persons and organizations) including their details, but doesn't permit any modifications.">Contacts read</Tooltip>                 | ❌                  |
| contacts:write  | <Tooltip tip="Provides read and write access to contacts (persons and organizations), allowing creation, modification, and deletion of contact information.">Contacts write</Tooltip>       | ❌                  |
| deals:read      | <Tooltip tip="Grants read-only access to deals including their stages, values, and associated data, but doesn't allow any changes.">Deals read</Tooltip>                              | ❌                  |
| deals:write     | <Tooltip tip="Provides full access to deals including creating, modifying, and deleting deals, as well as changing deal stages.">Deals write</Tooltip>                                | ❌                  |
| users:read      | <Tooltip tip="Allows reading user information across the organization, including team members' details, but no modifications.">Read users data</Tooltip>                              | ❌                  |
| admin           | <Tooltip tip="Provides full administrative access including organization settings, user management, and all data. This is the most privileged scope.">Admin</Tooltip>                   | ❌                  |

> ℹ️ Only the `base` scope is currently supported by OpenInt. Additional scopes will be enabled in future releases.

## Connection Settings

Pipedrive requires specifying your account's API domain. For most organizations, this will be in the format:

```json
{
  "api_domain": "https://yourcompany.pipedrive.com"
}
```

**Common issues:**
- Ensure the protocol is included (`https://`).
- The value must match your actual Pipedrive company subdomain.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Invalid client ID or secret:** Double-check credentials in Pipedrive Developer Hub.
- **Incorrect or missing scopes:** Only request `base` for now; others are not yet supported in OpenInt.
- **Mismatched redirect URI:** The callback URL you configure in Pipedrive *must* match exactly what is used in your OAuth flow (including protocol, trailing slash, etc).
- **api_domain errors:** Ensure your API domain matches the actual subdomain of your Pipedrive instance.
- **Authorization failed or returns error 400/401:** Check that your `client_id`, `client_secret`, and scopes are correct. Verify your app is published (or in test mode for sandbox).
- **Rate limiting or quota errors:** Reference the [Pipedrive API rate limits](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/api-rates-limits).

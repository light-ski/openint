**Status:** General Availability (GA) · OAuth2 Supported · [Official Discord OAuth2 Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2)

Integrate Discord authentication into your application using OpenInt. This guide walks you through the setup, supported OAuth2 scopes, and notes common pitfalls when building Discord integrations for your end users.

---

## Quickstart

Follow these steps to add Discord OAuth to your app using OpenInt:

1. **Register a Developer Application on Discord**
   Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application for your product.
2. **Obtain the Client ID and Client Secret**
   Under your application's "OAuth2" (or "General Information") settings, copy the `CLIENT ID` and `CLIENT SECRET`.
3. **Configure Redirect URI**
   In the Discord Developer Portal, add your OpenInt redirect URI to the list of Redirects.
   - For local development, ensure it matches your test environment URL.
4. **Configure OpenInt**
   Set `provider = "discord"` and add the client credentials in your OpenInt connection config. The minimum supported scope is `identify`.

```json
{
  "provider": "discord",
  "client_id": "YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "scopes": ["identify"],
  "redirect_uri": "YOUR_REGISTERED_REDIRECT_URI"
}
```

5. **Embed/OpenInt Connection**
   Embed the OpenInt connect flow in your app, or invoke the OAuth2 authorization URL as directed by OpenInt.

## How to Find Your Discord OAuth2 Client Credentials

1. Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click "New Application", set the name, and create the application.
3. In the sidebar, go to **OAuth2** > **General** to find the `CLIENT ID` and generate a `CLIENT SECRET`.
4. Under **OAuth2** > **Redirects**, add your OpenInt redirect URL (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/oauth/callback`).

For detailed instructions, see the [Discord OAuth2 docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#registering-an-application).

## OAuth2 Flow

OpenInt uses the standard OAuth2 Authorization Code flow for Discord. The following endpoints are used:

- **Authorization URL:**
  `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize`
- **Token Exchange URL:**
  `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token`

When a user authenticates with Discord through OpenInt, OpenInt requests the desired scopes and handles token exchange/refresh under the hood. For more details, see the [Authorization Code Grant section](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#authorization-code-grant).

## Supported Scopes

Below is a list of relevant Discord OAuth2 scopes. Only `identify` is currently supported via OpenInt; others are listed for future reference. For the full set of Discord scopes, see [Discord OAuth2 Scopes documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes).

| Scope | Description | Supported by OpenInt? |
|-------|-------------|:--------------------:|
| <Tooltip tip="Allows fetching the user's basic info (ID, username, avatar, etc.).">identify</Tooltip> | Basic user info (required by OpenInt for Discord connections). | Yes |
| <Tooltip tip="Access to the user's email address (requires identify).">email</Tooltip> | User's email address | No |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows access to user's connected third-party accounts.">connections</Tooltip> | Connected external accounts (Steam, Battle.net, etc.) | No |
| <Tooltip tip="Provides read-only access to the list of servers the user is in (server IDs and basic info).">guilds</Tooltip> | List of servers/guilds user belongs to | No |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows your app to join servers on the user's behalf.">guilds.join</Tooltip> | Join servers for user (write) | No |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows joining group DMs on the user's behalf.">gdm.join</Tooltip> | Join group DMs (write) | No |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows reading messages in private channels (DMs and group DMs) the user has access to.">messages.read</Tooltip> | Access to private DMs and group DMs messages | No |
| <Tooltip tip="Standard bot scope used for bot authorization. When used with bot permissions, can grant extensive access to servers.">bot</Tooltip> | Standard bot authorization: add bots to guilds | No |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows generating webhook URLs for a channel, enabling posting messages as the webhook.">webhook.incoming</Tooltip> | Webhook creation (write in channels) | No |

For a complete list and detailed descriptions, see the [Discord scopes reference](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes).

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

- **Invalid Redirect URI**: The redirect URI configured in the Discord Developer Portal **must** exactly match the URI passed to OpenInt. This is the most frequent source of OAuth errors.
- **Incorrect Client ID/Secret**: Ensure you use the correct credentials. Regenerate if unsure.
- **Missing Scopes**: OpenInt will request only supported scopes (currently `identify`). Attempting to request unsupported scopes will result in a failure.
- **Token Not Refreshed**: Tokens expire after a set period. Ensure your OpenInt backend handles token refresh appropriately (automatic with OpenInt's flow).
- **Permissions Issues**: Trying to use features requiring additional scopes will fail until those scopes are supported/added in OpenInt.
- **Discord rate limits or downtime**: Authentication may fail if Discord’s API is rate-limited or experiencing an incident. Check [Discord Status](https://discordstatus.com/).

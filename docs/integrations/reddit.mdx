# Reddit Integration

Integrate Reddit seamlessly into your platform using OpenInt. This guide walks you through configuring the Reddit connector, setting up OAuth2 credentials, understanding available scopes, and resolving common issues during setup. **Currently, OpenInt supports only the `wikiread` scope for Reddit.**

<Info>
This documentation is for engineers integrating Reddit with their application via OpenInt. For user-facing instructions, see your platform’s user guide.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- Reddit account with sufficient permissions
- Access to your OpenInt configuration
- Admin access to your company’s Reddit OAuth application settings

## 1. Register Your Reddit OAuth Application

You’ll need to create a Reddit app to obtain a Client ID and Client Secret, which OpenInt uses for OAuth flows.

### Steps to Register:

1. Log in to [Reddit Apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) with your Reddit account.
2. Scroll down to “Developed Applications” and click **“Create App”** or **“Create Another App”**.
3. Fill out the form:
   - **name**: A meaningful name for your app (e.g., your company’s name).
   - **description**: Short description for your integration.
   - **redirect uri**: Must match what you configure in OpenInt (e.g., `https://YOUR-DOMAIN/oauth/callback/reddit`). 
     <Tip>Reddit requires the exact redirect URI to be provided—wildcards are not accepted. Any mismatch will cause authorization to fail.</Tip>
   - **application type**: Select **web app**.
4. Save the application.
5. Copy the **Client ID** (listed under your app’s name) and **Secret** (in the app details).

For official steps, see [Reddit OAuth2 Docs](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2).

## 2. Configure Reddit with OpenInt

Provide your Client ID, Client Secret, and any relevant configuration (scopes, redirect URI) in your OpenInt connector setup. Here is a sample snippet:

```json
{
  "provider": "reddit",
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "redirect_uri": "https://YOUR-DOMAIN/oauth/callback/reddit",
  "scopes": ["wikiread"]
}
```
<Info>
Currently, OpenInt only supports the `wikiread` scope (read wiki pages in public subreddits). Other scopes will be supported in future updates.
</Info>

## 3. Reddit OAuth Scopes

Reddit OAuth2 allows fine-grained permission control via scopes. Below is a list of all Reddit OAuth2 scopes, with descriptions shown in tooltips. Only `wikiread` is currently supported by OpenInt.

<Info>
See the [official Reddit OAuth2 scope documentation](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Scopes) for the complete and most current list.

## 4. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<Warning>
The **redirect URI** you enter on Reddit’s app site <strong>must exactly match</strong> what you set in OpenInt, or authentication will fail.
</Warning>

- **Missing or incorrect scopes:** OpenInt currently only supports `wikiread`; other scopes will be ignored until supported.
- **Wrong Reddit app type:** For OAuth login, use “web app” (not “script”) when registering your Reddit app.
- **App not set to “permanent” duration:** OpenInt expects `duration=permanent` for persistent tokens.

<Tip>
If authentication fails, double-check that your client ID, client secret, and redirect URI are all correct and that your Reddit app is properly configured.
</Tip>

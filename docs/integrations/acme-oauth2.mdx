# Acme OAuth2 Integration (Developer Guide)

This guide explains how to add Acme OAuth (social-media platform) integration to your product using OpenInt. OpenInt handles all of the OAuth2 flow, letting your users seamlessly connect their Acme accounts to your platform.

## Features

- **OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant (PKCE - S256)**
- Granular scope support, proxying all tokens and flows
- Currently supported: `read:profile` scope for accessing user profile info

## Quickstart

Follow these steps to integrate Acme OAuth2 via OpenInt:

1. **Register Your Application in Acme:**
    - Go to the Acme Developer Portal (URL will depend on Acme's upstream system; substitute accordingly).
    - Create a new OAuth2 application.
    - Set the Redirect URI to your OpenInt instance's redirect endpoint. This is typically:
      ```
      https://YOUR_OPENINT_DOMAIN/connect/acme-oauth2/oauth/callback
      ```
    - Obtain your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for Acme.

2. **Configure OpenInt:**
    - In your OpenInt connector configuration for Acme, set the obtained Client ID and Secret.

      Example YAML snippet:
      ```yaml
      connectors:
        acme-oauth2:
          client_id: <YOUR_ACME_CLIENT_ID>
          client_secret: <YOUR_ACME_CLIENT_SECRET>
      ```

3. **Initiate the OAuth2 Flow:**
    - Use the OpenInt-provided endpoints to initiate OAuth2 connections for your users. OpenInt will handle PKCE (S256) and proxy all authorization and token requests securely.
    - Typically, you embed or link the Connect Portal as described in the OpenInt integration docs.

## OAuth2 Configuration Details

- **Grant Type:** Authorization Code (with PKCE - S256)
- **Authorization Endpoint:** Handled by OpenInt (`/acme-oauth2/authorize`)
- **Token Endpoint:** Handled by OpenInt (`/acme-oauth2/token`)
- **Introspection & Revocation:** Proxied via OpenInt
- **Scope Separator:** Space (` `)
- **Redirect URI:** Must point to your OpenInt deployment's callback URL

> **Note:** All OAuth2 endpoints interact _only with OpenInt_. You do not connect directly to Acme’s public OAuth endpoints.

## Scopes Comparison

The table below shows Acme OAuth’s supported scopes and states which are exposed by OpenInt. For the most up-to-date upstream information, see [Acme's developer documentation](#) (insert link when known).

| Scope         | Supported by OpenInt | Description                                                                 |
|-------------- |:-------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <Tooltip tip="Read profile information">read:profile</Tooltip> | ✓                 | Allows reading of user’s profile info.                                       |
| <Tooltip tip="Write posts (not currently supported by OpenInt)">write:posts</Tooltip> |                       | Enables creation and editing of posts on behalf of user.                     |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

- **Incorrect client credentials:** Ensure you’ve copied the correct Client ID and Secret from Acme and placed them in your OpenInt secrets/config.
- **Invalid or non-matching Redirect URI:** Acme will reject OAuth requests if the URI does not match exactly what’s set in the developer portal.
- **Not enabling PKCE:** OpenInt requires PKCE (S256) and handles this automatically, but external attempts to bypass PKCE will fail.
- **Scope mismatch:** Only the `read:profile` scope is supported by OpenInt currently. Requesting additional scopes will result in a failure.

For general troubleshooting, see the [Connect FAQ](/connect/faq).

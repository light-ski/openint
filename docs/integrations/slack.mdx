# Slack Integration

Leverage OpenInt to embed Slack integrations into your application, allowing your users to securely connect Slack workspaces for data and automation scenarios. This document guides you through setup, authorization, scope configuration, and common pitfalls encountered in Slack integrations.

> For Slack’s upstream documentation, see [Slack OAuth Scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes) and [Slack App Management](https://api.slack.com/apps).

## Prerequisites

- An active OpenInt account
- A Slack App ([create/manage here](https://api.slack.com/apps))
- Access to your Slack App’s OAuth credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)
- Admin rights (or permissions) in your OpenInt dashboard and in your Slack workspace

## Quickstart: Connecting Slack via OpenInt

1. **Create or Configure a Slack App:**
    - Go to the [Slack App page](https://api.slack.com/apps).
    - Create a new app or select an existing one.
    - In the "OAuth & Permissions" section:
        - Note your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
        - Set your **Redirect URL(s):** Add OpenInt’s redirect URL or your custom redirect endpoint (format: `https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/api/callback/slack`, per your OpenInt config).
        - Under **Scopes**, configure the required scopes (see Supported Scopes below). Only scopes requested by OpenInt will be prompted to the user at consent.

2. **Configure OpenInt with Slack Credentials:**
    - In your OpenInt connector dashboard or backend configuration, input your Slack OAuth credentials:

      ```json
      // Example configuration
      {
        "provider": "slack",
        "client_id": "<your-slack-client-id>",
        "client_secret": "<your-slack-client-secret>",
        "scopes": ["users:read"]
      }
      ```
    - Only scopes implemented by OpenInt, such as `users:read`, will be requested by default. Contact OpenInt support if your use case needs broader scopes.

3. **Embed and Initiate the Connection Flow:**
    - Use OpenInt’s Connect Portal component or API to allow users to authenticate and authorize Slack from your app’s UI. See [Connect Portal documentation](/docs/connect/embed) for UI/API integration steps.

4. **Handle the Callback:**
    - OpenInt will exchange the authorization code for an access token, completing the auth setup for each connected workspace.

## Supported and Available Slack Scopes

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

**1. Invalid Redirect URI:**
   - Ensure the redirect URI in your Slack App settings _exactly_ matches that used in your OpenInt configuration. This is a leading cause of failed OAuth handoffs.

**2. Insufficient Scope or Permission Errors:**
   - Slack will only issue tokens for the scopes requested by your app _and_ approved by the workspace admin. Make sure all required scopes are listed in both your Slack App and OpenInt connector configuration.

**3. Invalid Credentials:**
   - Double check Client ID and Secret values in your OpenInt dashboard/API config.

**4. User Cancelled Authorization:**
   - If a user cancels, OpenInt will handle the callback error, but your frontend should display a friendly error prompt.

**5. Consent Screen Not Showing Scopes:**
   - Only enabled and requested scopes will be displayed for approval; confirm both Slack and OpenInt settings are aligned for your integration use case.

**6. Token Expiry and Re-authentication:**
   - Slack OAuth tokens may expire; ensure your integration uses OpenInt's token refresh logic if required (see OpenInt docs for details).

For further details, refer to [Slack’s authentication troubleshooting guide](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2) or contact OpenInt support.

# Google Calendar Integration (Developer Guide)

Integrate Google Calendar with your application using OpenInt. This guide will walk you through the process of configuring OAuth2 authentication, connecting scopes, and troubleshooting common issues.

## Overview

**Integration name:** Google Calendar  
**Status:** Generally Available (GA)  
**Supported audience:** Business  
**Verticals:** Other

OpenInt enables your users to securely connect their Google Calendar accounts to your platform. As of this release, OpenInt supports read-only access to calendar settings via the `calendar.settings.readonly` scope. Additional functionality can be requested (see below).

---

## Quickstart: Integrating Google Calendar via OpenInt

### 1. Enable Google Calendar API & Create OAuth Credentials

1. **Create or use an existing Google Cloud project:**  
    - Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
    - Select your project (or create one).
2. **Enable the Calendar API for your project:**  
    - Visit the [API Library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library).
    - Search for "Google Calendar API", select it, and click **Enable**.
3. **Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:**  
    - Navigate to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
    - Click **Create Credentials** → **OAuth client ID**.
    - Application type: **Web application**.
    - **Authorized redirect URIs:** Add your app’s OAuth redirect endpoints. These must exactly match what you configure in OpenInt (case and trailing slash are significant!). Typical for local development: `http://localhost:3000/api/oauth/callback/google-calendar`  
    - [Google's documentation on creating OAuth credentials →](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred)
4. **Download your client credentials.** You’ll get a `client_id` and `client_secret`.

### 2. Configure OpenInt with OAuth Credentials

Update your OpenInt connector configuration to use your Google OAuth client credentials and desired scopes:

```ts
// .env or deployment secrets
OPENINT_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
OPENINT_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
// Make sure to add the correct redirect URI as allowed in Google Cloud Console
```

Within your OpenInt integration setup or connector config, specify the calendar scope(s) you wish to request:

```js
scopes: [
  'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.settings.readonly',
]
```

### 3. Initiate OAuth2 Flow via OpenInt Connect

Once configured, users will be prompted to authenticate with Google Calendar using your white-labeled interface powered by OpenInt.

## OAuth2 Scope Mapping

OpenInt currently supports the following Google Calendar scope:

| Scope | OpenInt Supported | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| <Tooltip tip="Provides read-only access to the user's calendar settings (e.g., time zone, working hours). No access to events or calendars.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.settings.readonly`</Tooltip> | ✅ | <Tooltip tip="Provides read-only access to the user's calendar settings (e.g., time zone, working hours). No access to events or calendars.">Calendar settings (read-only)</Tooltip> |

Below are other available Calendar API scopes **not yet supported via OpenInt**, but available from Google. Reach out to the OpenInt team to request support for additional scopes:

| Scope | OpenInt Supported | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| <Tooltip tip="Provides full read/write access to the user's calendars, including events, ACLs (access control lists), and settings. This is the most permissive scope.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`</Tooltip> | ❌ | <Tooltip tip="Provides full read/write access to the user's calendars, including events, ACLs, and settings. This is the most permissive scope.">Full calendar access (read/write)</Tooltip> |
| <Tooltip tip="Provides read/write access to events on the user's calendars, but does not include access to calendar metadata (e.g., ACLs or settings).">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`</Tooltip> | ❌ | <Tooltip tip="Provides read/write access to events on the user's calendars, but does not include access to calendar metadata (e.g., ACLs or settings).">Events (read/write)</Tooltip> |
| <Tooltip tip="Provides read-only access to events on the user's calendars. No write operations are allowed.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly`</Tooltip> | ❌ | <Tooltip tip="Provides read-only access to events on the user's calendars. No write operations are allowed.">Events (read-only)</Tooltip> |
| <Tooltip tip="Provides read-only access to the user's calendars, including events, ACLs, and settings. No write operations are allowed.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`</Tooltip> | ❌ | <Tooltip tip="Provides read-only access to the user's calendars, including events, ACLs, and settings. No write operations are allowed.">Calendars + events (read-only)</Tooltip> |

## Example OpenInt Connector Config

```ts
import { googleCalendarConnector } from 'openint';

const connector = googleCalendarConnector({
  clientId: process.env.OPENINT_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.OPENINT_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET,
  redirectUri: 'https://yourapp.com/api/oauth/callback/google-calendar',
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.settings.readonly']
});
```

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **redirect_uri_mismatch:** The most common error is a mismatch between your configured redirect URI in Google Cloud Console and the redirect URI used by OpenInt. Ensure these match _exactly_, including protocol (`http`/`https`), path, and trailing slash.
    - See Google’s [redirect URI validation rules](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#uri-validation).
- **OAuth consent screen not published:** If you use sensitive or restricted scopes (when OpenInt adds support), your OAuth app may require manual review and publishing.
- **Wrong client credentials:** Check you have used `client_id` and `client_secret` from the correct OAuth 2.0 client.
- **Scope not enabled:** Requesting a scope via OpenInt that's not enabled on your Google Cloud application will trigger user-facing or server errors.
- **Missing refresh tokens:** For long-lived access, ensure your OAuth consent/config requests `access_type=offline` and `prompt=consent` (see [Google's docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingclient)).

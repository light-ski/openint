# LinkedIn Integration (Developer Guide)

> This guide shows engineers how to use OpenInt to embed LinkedIn login and data sync—enabling ATS/social-media, business analytics, and social features—into your app.

## Overview

OpenInt's LinkedIn integration lets you connect users' LinkedIn accounts, fetch their identity and profile data, and leverage organization or social capabilities (where permitted). Integration is OAuth 2.0-based and supports enterprise-ready flows for robust, auditable authentication.

**OpenInt currently supports the following LinkedIn capabilities:**
- Basic user profile (via OpenID Connect / `profile` scope)
- Email address (`email` scope)
- OpenID identity (`openid` scope)

Additional scopes for organization management or marketing are not yet supported and may be added on the roadmap.

---

## Prerequisites
1. Access to [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/).
2. An OpenInt project set up in your product/app.
3. Your platform URL(s) for use as redirect URIs (must be HTTPS).

---

## Setting up Your LinkedIn App (OAuth2)

1. Go to the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/new) and create a new application.
2. Save your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (available under the **Auth** tab for your app).
3. **Set Redirect URI**: Under the **Auth** tab, add your callback URL. E.g., `https://yourdomain.com/oauth/callback/linkedin`.
   - Must be an HTTPS, fully qualified URL matching your backend’s OAuth handling endpoint (no fragments, parameters ignored).
4. Configure your OpenInt integration as shown below.

**LinkedIn OAuth2 endpoints:**
- Authorization: `https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization`
- Token: `https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken`

Refer to [LinkedIn's Authorization Code Flow documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow) for more details.

## Supported and Available Scopes

See the [official LinkedIn scopes list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/getting-access?view=li-lms-2022-06) for full details. OpenInt currently only supports the most common OpenID scopes for standard auth; others may require partner approval or roadmap work.

| Scope                | Supported by OpenInt | Description |
|----------------------|:-------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `openid`             |       ✅             | <Tooltip text="Enables OpenID Connect flows, returns user identity in ID token.">Enables authentication and profile info via OIDC.</Tooltip> |
| `email`              |       ✅             | <Tooltip text="Primary email address (requires explicit consent).">Access to member's primary email.</Tooltip> |
| `r_basicprofile`     |        ❌            | <Tooltip text="Full basic profile: experience, education, skills, recommendations.">Full member profile access. (Partner required, deprecated for new apps.)</Tooltip> |
| `w_member_social`    |        ❌            | <Tooltip text="Post/comment/like as member.">Create, comment, and like posts for the member.</Tooltip> |

## OpenInt LinkedIn Configuration Example

```ts
// openint/connectors/cnext/json-defs/linkedin.ts
import linkedinConnector from 'openint/connectors/cnext/json-defs/linkedin'

openint.addConnector(linkedinConnector)

// Example: How to use in an OpenInt integration config
const linkedin = {
  clientId: '<YOUR_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID>',
  clientSecret: '<YOUR_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET>',
  redirectUri: 'https://yourdomain.com/oauth/callback/linkedin',
  scopes: ['profile', 'email', 'openid'], // Only these currently supported
}
```

## Common Mistakes and Pitfalls

- **Redirect URI Mismatch:** The redirect URI in your LinkedIn app must exactly match what is sent in your authorization request (including protocol and path).
- **Scope Misconfiguration:** Requesting LinkedIn scopes your app or OpenInt does not support will result in `invalid_scope` errors. Only request `profile`, `email`, and `openid` unless OpenInt adds others.
- **App Not in Production:** Some LinkedIn features or APIs require your app to be approved or published; if you see permission or 403 errors, check your app status in the LinkedIn Developer Portal.
- **Secret Safety:** Never expose your client secret in frontend code or repositories.

# Google Docs Integration via OpenInt

Integrate Google Docs functionality into your application securely and efficiently using OpenInt's OAUTH2-powered connector. This guide walks you through the entire setup and highlights best practices for a robust, reliable integration.

> **Audience:** Product & platform engineers at partners embedding Google Docs capabilities via OpenInt.
> 
> **Stage:** General Availability (GA)

## Prerequisites

1. An active [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) account.
2. Access to the [OpenInt Console](https://app.openint.dev/dashboard/sign-up).
3. Appropriate admin permissions to register OAuth credentials in both OpenInt and Google Cloud.

---

## Step 1: Set Up a Google Cloud Project & Enable APIs

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project.
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
4. Search for **Google Docs API** and click **Enable**.

<Callout type="info">
You must also enable the **Google Drive API** if your integration will use any Drive-based scopes (e.g., `drive.file`, `drive`, or `drive.readonly`).
</Callout>

---

## Step 2: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud

1. In your project, go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
2. Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.
3. Select **Web application** as the application type.
4. Enter an appropriate name (e.g., "OpenInt Google Docs Integration").
5. In **Authorized redirect URIs**, include the callback URL from OpenInt. Find this in the OpenInt Console or your organization’s onboarding materials. It will look like:

   ```
   https://connect.openint.dev/oauth/callback
   ```

6. Click **Create**. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You will need these in OpenInt.

<Callout type="warning">
If you do not configure redirect URIs **exactly** as provided by OpenInt, the OAuth flow will fail with a `redirect_uri_mismatch` error.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Configure Google Docs in OpenInt

1. Go to the [OpenInt Console](https://app.openint.dev/dashboard).
2. Navigate to **Connector Configs** and select or create a Google Docs connector.
3. Enter your Google Client ID and Client Secret in the connector configuration form.
4. Choose the scopes your integration requires. **OpenInt currently supports:**

    - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly` <Tooltip content="Provides access only to the currently open Google Docs document (when used with Docs add-ons). Most limited scope for temporary access.">ⓘ</Tooltip>

   *Other Google Docs and Drive scopes are not currently supported by OpenInt.*

5. Save your connector configuration.
6. Verify the new connector appears in your available connectors list.

## Supported OAuth Scopes

Below is a comparison of the full set of Google Docs-related OAuth scopes and which are currently supported by OpenInt.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Scope</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Supported by OpenInt?</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Full read/write access to all Google Docs documents. Allows viewing, creating, editing, and deleting documents.">Full access</Tooltip></td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Read-only access to all Google Docs documents. Allows viewing document content and metadata but no modifications.">Read-only</Tooltip></td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Access to Google Drive files that the app has created or been explicitly granted access to; limited scope compared to full Drive access.">Limited Drive access</Tooltip></td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Read-only access to all Google Drive files including Docs; broader access for viewing compared to drive.file.">Read-only Drive</Tooltip></td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Full read/write access to all Google Drive files including Docs. The broadest permission for Docs/Drive operations.">Full Drive access</Tooltip></td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Only provides access to the currently open Google Doc, and only when used with Docs add-ons. Most restrictive.">Current Doc Only</Tooltip></td>
      <td><strong>Yes</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Step 4: Embed OpenInt Connect in Your App

See the [OpenInt Embedding Guide](/connect/embed) for a full walkthrough. Below is a typical flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Customer Token in your Backend">
    Use the OpenInt SDK to generate a customer authentication token for your user. For example (JS SDK):
    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript
      const openint = new Openint({
        apiKey: process.env['OPENINT_API_KEY'],
      })
      const { token } = await openint.createToken('YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID')
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Embed the Connect Widget">
    Render the widget in your app:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript
      import { ConnectEmbed } from '@openint/connect'
      return <ConnectEmbed token={token} />
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning">
<b>OAuth Errors:</b> Most configuration errors are related to OAuth misconfiguration. Double-check redirect URIs, API/project enablement, and scope selection.
</Callout>

- **Redirect URI mismatch:** Redirect URIs in Google Cloud must match those in OpenInt exactly.
- **Insufficient Permission errors:** Only the `documents.currentonly` scope is currently available. If broader access is needed, contact OpenInt or watch for product updates.
- **Missing API enabled:** Both Google Docs and (sometimes) Google Drive APIs must be enabled in your Google Cloud project.
- **App not verified:** Sensitive or restricted scopes require additional Google verification—currently not needed as OpenInt only uses a limited scope.

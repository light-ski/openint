# Integrating Google Docs

OpenInt allows you to quickly connect to Google Docs using OAuth2 authentication. Follow the steps below to create a Google Cloud project, configure OAuth consent, obtain credentials, and use them with OpenInt’s Google Docs connector.

For reference, this guide follows the style of <a href="https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html" target="_blank">this Google Drive Client ID tutorial</a>. You can find the full list of Google Docs API OAuth scopes <a href="https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth" target="_blank">here</a>.
</Callout>

## 1. Prerequisites

- A Google account with access to the Google Cloud Console.
- OpenInt account and access to your integration configuration.

## 2. Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click the project drop-down (top left) and select **New Project**.
3. Enter a project name and click **Create**.

## 3. Enable the Google Docs API

1. In your new project, search for “Google Docs API” in the top search bar.
2. Select **Google Docs API** from the results.
3. Click **Enable**.

## 4. Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**.
2. Choose **External** for User Type (recommended for most integrations).
3. Fill out **App Information** (App name, User support email, Developer contact information).
4. Add your OpenInt application's domain under **Authorized domains**.
5. Save and continue. You can skip Scopes for now and go back to add them later. Save and continue through the steps until finished.

## 5. Create OAuth Credentials

1. In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
2. Click **+ Create Credentials** → **OAuth client ID**.
3. For **Application type**, select **Web application**.
4. Enter a name.
5. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the following URI:

   ```
   https://console.openint.dev/api/connect/callback/google-docs
   ```
   Or, for local development:
   ```
   https://localhost:3000/api/connect/callback/google-docs
   ```

6. Click **Create**. You will see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## 6. Add Scopes

You can find the list of all available Google Docs API scopes [here](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth). For basic read/write access, request at least:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents
```

Add any other scopes your use case requires.

## 7. Configure in OpenInt Console

1. Open your OpenInt Console and go to **Connector Configurations**.
2. Select **Add Connector** or edit your existing configuration for Google Docs.
3. Input your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the credentials above.
4. Specify all OAuth scopes your app needs (space-separated).
5. Save your configuration.

## 8. Test the Connection

Use the OpenInt dashboard or API to initiate the connection flow for a test user. You should be redirected to Google's OAuth screen, and, after successful authorization, your app will have API access to Google Docs for the specified scopes.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure your Google project is in "In production" mode for use with accounts outside your organization.
- Double-check that **Authorized Redirect URIs** in Google match exactly the callback URI OpenInt expects.
- If users receive a “scope not allowed” error, verify that all requested scopes are correctly enabled and approved in the Google Cloud Console.
- For local development, you may need to use a self-signed certificate and serve OpenInt locally over HTTPS.

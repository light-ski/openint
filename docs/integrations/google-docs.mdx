# Google Docs Integration via OpenInt

Integrate Google Docs into your app with OpenInt by leveraging secure OAuth 2.0 authentication and clear data-scoped permissions. This guide walks you through configuring your Google Cloud project, registering OAuth credentials, and using OpenInt to enable Google Docs access—presented in a step-by-step style inspired by [2BrightSparks](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html).

---

## Prerequisites

- Access to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- An OpenInt project with admin privileges
- Familiarity with your app’s OAuth callback URLs

---

## 1. Set Up Google OAuth Credentials

Follow these steps to register and obtain OAuth credentials for your app:

1. **Create or Select a Project:**  
   Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), sign in, and create a new project or choose an existing one.
2. **Enable Google Docs API:**  
   Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**, search for “Google Docs API”, and click **Enable** while your project is selected. *(Omitting this step will cause all auth to fail!)*
3. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen:**  
   In **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**, select **External** unless your integration is limited to your organization. Fill in app details, and add yourself as a test user if working in development.
4. **Create OAuth Credentials:**  
   In **APIs & Services > Credentials**, click **+ Create Credentials** > **OAuth client ID**. Select **Web application**, name it, and proceed.
5. **Register Authorized Redirect URIs:**  
   These must match EXACTLY what your application and OpenInt expect (case, path, protocol). For example:
   -   `https://yourapp.com/openint/callback/google-docs`
   -   `http://localhost:3000/openint/callback/google-docs`
6. **Download and Safeguard Your Client ID and Secret.** You’ll use these values in your OpenInt configuration.

## 2. Connecting Google Docs with OpenInt

Add your **Google OAuth Client ID** and **Client Secret** to your OpenInt dashboard or configuration store for the Google Docs connector. This allows OpenInt to facilitate user authentication on your behalf.

### Example OpenInt Connector Config

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "OAUTH2",
    "client_id": "<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>",
    "client_secret": "<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>",
    "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly"]
  }
}
```

> **Note:** As of this integration, OpenInt only supports the `documents.currentonly` scope. This restricts access to the currently open document and is intended for add-on or limited use scenarios.

---

## 3. OAuth Scopes Comparison

OpenInt supports only a subset of the official Google Docs API scopes. Here’s a breakdown:

| Scope | Description | Supported by OpenInt? |
|-------|-------------|:---------------------:|
| <Tooltip content="Provides full read/write access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing, creating, editing, and deleting documents.">[documents](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents)</Tooltip> | Full access Docs: read, write, delete | ❌ |
| <Tooltip content="Provides read-only access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing document content and metadata but no modifications.">[documents.readonly](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly)</Tooltip> | Read-only Docs | ❌ |
| <Tooltip content="Provides access only to the currently open Google Docs document (when used with Docs add-ons). Most limited scope for temporary access.">[documents.currentonly](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly)</Tooltip> | **Current Only** – Access limited to currently open doc | ✅ |
| <Tooltip content="Provides access to Google Docs files that the app has created or been explicitly granted access to. Limited to specific files rather than all documents.">[drive.file](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file)</Tooltip> | File-by-file access | ❌ |
| <Tooltip content="Provides read-only access to all Google Drive files including Docs, but no modifications allowed. Wider access than drive.file but limited to viewing.">[drive.readonly](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly)</Tooltip> | Read-only all of Drive | ❌ |
| <Tooltip content="Provides full read/write access to all Google Drive files including Docs. The broadest permission for Docs/Drive operations.">[drive](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive)</Tooltip> | Full access to all of Drive | ❌ |

<Tip>
**Best Practice:** Always use the most limited scope that meets your use case to ensure a smooth app verification process and best user privacy.

## 4. Initiating the OAuth2 Flow

Once OpenInt is configured, redirect users to the OpenInt Connect UI for Google Docs. This will:
1. Prompt user consent using your configured scopes and branding
2. Acquire an authorization code and exchange it for tokens

**Example:**
```typescript
// Example with OpenInt SDK or custom flow
openint.connect('google-docs') // Prompts OAuth consent for Google Docs
```

Once authentication succeeds, OpenInt will handle token storage and refresh automatically.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Invalid redirect_uri:** The OAuth redirect URI must match exactly between Google Cloud and OpenInt settings (case, scheme, path, and port!).
- **API not enabled:** Forgetting to enable the Google Docs API causes silent failures.
- **Missing consent screen info:** All fields must be filled, and test users added if in dev/test phase.
- **Incorrect scopes:** Attempting to use non-supported scopes (such as full `documents` or `drive.file`) will result in permission errors or no-op permissions.
- **App verification/consent errors:** Using sensitive or unverified scopes can prompt users with warnings or block users outside test users.

<Tip>
Review [Google’s app verification requirements](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13464321#ss-rs-requirements) if needing additional scopes in future releases.

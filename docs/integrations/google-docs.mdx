# Google Docs Integration Guide

Connect your application to Google Docs using OpenInt’s secure, OAuth-based integration. This guide will help you configure your Google Cloud project, set up the required OAuth credentials, and link them in OpenInt, allowing seamless access to Google Docs features for your users.

---

## Prerequisites
- An active Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
- Access to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- Admin access to your OpenInt dashboard
- Permissions to create and configure OAuth credentials in your GCP project

---

## Step 1: Create and Configure a Google Cloud Project
1. **Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).**
2. **Select an existing project** or **create a new project** from the project dropdown at the top.

---

## Step 2: Enable the Google Docs API
1. In your Google Cloud project, search for “Google Docs API” from the top bar.
2. Click on it and press “Enable”.

---

## Step 3: Set Up OAuth Consent Screen
1. In the left sidebar, click **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
2. For user type, select **External** and click **Create**.
3. Fill out required fields:
   - **App name**
   - **User support email**
   - **Developer contact email**
4. For **Scopes**, only add `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly` (see table below).
5. In the **Test users** section, add the email addresses used for testing (including your own and company emails as needed).
6. Save and continue. For further reference, go to [Google’s instructions](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html).

---

## Step 4: Create OAuth Credentials (Client ID & Secret)
1. In the sidebar, go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
2. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID**.
3. For **Application type**, select **Web Application**.
4. Name the client (e.g., `OpenInt Google Docs Connector`).
5. For **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the OpenInt redirect URI (e.g., `https://your-app.openint.dev/callback/google-docs`). (Check with your OpenInt deployment for the correct value.)
6. Click **Create**.
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and store them securely.

---

## Step 5: Configure Google Docs in OpenInt

Update or create your Google Docs connector configuration in OpenInt. Example config:

```json
{
  "client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
  "client_secret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
  "redirect_uri": "<YOUR_OPENINT_REDIRECT_URI>",
  "scopes": ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly"]
}
```

> **Note:** OpenInt currently only supports the `documents.currentonly` scope for the Google Docs API.

Refer to the [Connector Configuration](/core-concepts-v0/connector-config) page for OpenInt config details.

---

## Supported & Unsupported Google Docs API Scopes

You must explicitly specify the narrowest scope required for your integration. Currently, OpenInt supports the **most limited, document-specific** scope only.

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Setup Issues">

- **Missing or wrong scope:** Ensure you use `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly` only — other Docs scopes are NOT supported by OpenInt.
- **API not enabled:** The Google Docs API must be enabled before creating credentials.
- **Wrong redirect URI:** Make sure the redirect URI matches exactly what is set in OpenInt and in your Google Cloud app.
- **Consent screen incomplete:** All required fields must be filled; test users must be added.
- **Client ID/Secret issues:** Credentials are NOT recoverable later—store them securely.
- **Trying to use external users before publishing app:** Only published apps can be used by external users; for testing, ensure all emails are listed as "Test users".
- **Forgetting to save config changes in OpenInt:** After updating credentials or scope, re-save connector settings and retry authentication.

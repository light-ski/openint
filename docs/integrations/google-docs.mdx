# Integrating Google Docs via OpenInt

This guide describes how to connect your app to Google Docs through OpenInt using OAuth2 authentication. We'll walk through obtaining credentials from Google, configuring the integration in OpenInt, listing all relevant OAuth scopes, and highlighting important troubleshooting steps. This documentation is intended for engineers integrating Google Docs on behalf of their end users.

> **Note:** As of now, OpenInt supports access only to the [documents.currentonly](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth) scope. Broader Google Docs and Drive scopes are not yet implemented in OpenInt.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- A Google account
- An OpenInt deployment (self-hosted or embedded)

## Step 1: Create Google OAuth2 Credentials

Follow these steps to register your app and obtain the OAuth2 Client ID and Secret required for integration:

1. **Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).**
2. **Select a project** (or create a new one by clicking the project dropdown in the top left and selecting "New Project").
3. **Enable the Google Docs API**:
    - In the left navigation, click **APIs & Services > Library**.
    - Search for "Google Docs API" and click **Enable**.
4. **Configure the OAuth consent screen:**
    - Go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
    - Set **User Type** to "External" and click **Create**.
    - Fill in required fields: **App name**, **User support email**, and **Developer contact email**.
    - Save and continue. (You will add scopes in the next section.)
5. **Add OAuth scopes:**
    - You will be prompted to add scopes. For OpenInt, you should use:
      - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`
    - For details on all available scopes and what they do, see the table below.
    - Save and continue.
6. **Add test users:**
    - Google requires you to add test users (yourself and other developers) before submitting for production.
    - Enter the email addresses and save.
7. **Create OAuth credentials:**
    - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    - Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID**.
    - Choose **Web application** as the application type.
    - Enter a name (e.g., "OpenInt Google Docs Integration").
    - Add the required redirect URI for your OpenInt deployment (consult your OpenInt config for the appropriate value).
    - Click **Create** and copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for use in OpenInt configuration.
8. **Publish the OAuth consent screen** (for production use) or continue in testing mode by restricting access to test users only.

For more detail, you can reference [Google's step-by-step instructions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent) and this [walkthrough example](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html).

## Step 2: Configure OpenInt with OAuth Credentials

You need to provide OpenInt the Client ID and Secret you obtained from Google Cloud Console. This is typically done via your OpenInt secrets/configuration system. Ensure that the redirect URI used in the Google OAuth configuration matches the URI expected by your OpenInt deployment.

Example OpenInt connector config snippet:

```json
{
  "provider": "google-docs",
  "oauth_client_id": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
  "oauth_client_secret": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

Refer to [OpenIntâ€™s integration guide](/docs/getting-started/integrations) for environment-specific setup.

## Supported and Available OAuth Scopes

Below is a list of Google Docs (and related Drive) OAuth scopes. <Badge type="tip">As of now, OpenInt only supports <code>documents.currentonly</code>. Support for broader scopes may be added in the future.</Badge>

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Scope</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>OpenInt Supported?</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><Tooltip text="Provides access only to the currently open Google Docs document (when used with Docs add-ons). Most limited scope for temporary access.">documents.currentonly</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Access to current document only</td>
      <td><Badge type="success">Yes</Badge></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><Tooltip text="Provides full read/write access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing, creating, editing, and deleting documents.">documents</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Full read/write to all Docs</td>
      <td><Badge type="danger">No</Badge></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><Tooltip text="Provides read-only access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing document content and metadata but no modifications.">documents.readonly</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Read-only Docs access</td>
      <td><Badge type="danger">No</Badge></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><Tooltip text="Provides access to Google Docs files the app has created or explicitly has access to. Limited to specific files rather than all documents.">drive.file</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Limited Drive file access</td>
      <td><Badge type="danger">No</Badge></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><Tooltip text="Provides full read/write access to all Google Drive files including Docs. The broadest permission for Docs/Drive operations.">drive</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Full read/write to all Drive/Docs</td>
      <td><Badge type="danger">No</Badge></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><Tooltip text="Provides read-only access to all Google Drive files including Docs, but no modifications allowed. Wider access than drive.file but limited to viewing.">drive.readonly</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Read-only Drive/Docs access</td>
      <td><Badge type="danger">No</Badge></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

For additional details and latest scope information, refer to the [official Google Docs API authorization documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth).

## Common Setup Mistakes & Troubleshooting

- **Incorrect redirect URI**: The redirect URI registered in Google Console must exactly match the one used by your OpenInt deployment.
- **Not enabling the Google Docs API**: Access will fail if you do not enable the API in your Google project.
- **Consent screen misconfiguration**: Missing required user support/developer emails, or failure to add test users, can block authorization.
- **Using unsupported scopes**: OpenInt currently supports only `documents.currentonly`. Attempting broader access will result in authorization errors.
- **Production rollout**: Ensure you publish your consent screen or restrict to "test users" as appropriate for your rollout phase.

If you encounter issues, review the [official troubleshooting resources](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/auth-overview) and double-check all settings.

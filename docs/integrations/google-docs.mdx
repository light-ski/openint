Integrate your application with Google Docs using OpenInt's prebuilt connector. This guide covers configuration, OAuth setup, scopes, and common troubleshooting for a seamless connection to the Google Docs API.

## Introduction

OpenInt enables you to embed Google Docs connectivity directly into your platform, allowing your users to securely authorize and interact with their Google Docs data. This integration uses OAuth 2.0 and supports a subset of the Google Docs API scopes, with production-ready stability (GA stage).

> **Note:** As of this release, OpenInt supports the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly` scope for temporary access to the currently open Google Docs document.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- A Google account for app registration
- An active OpenInt instance
- Familiarity with [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)

## Step 1: Set Up a Google Cloud Project

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Select an existing project or create a new one.

## Step 2: Enable Google Docs API

1. In your Google Cloud Project, go to **APIs & Services → Library**.
2. Search for "Google Docs API" and click **Enable**.

## Step 3: Configure the OAuth Consent Screen

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**.
2. Choose "External" if your users are outside your organization.
3. Fill in required fields (App name, User support email, Developer contact info).
4. Add test users (your email and any internal testers).
5. Save and continue.

## Step 4: Add Required Scopes

1. In the OAuth consent screen, click **Add or Remove Scopes**.
2. For OpenInt's default flow, add:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`
3. For future use, review all [Google Docs API scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth) and only request what your use case needs.

## Step 5: Create OAuth Client Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
2. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS → OAuth client ID**.
3. Choose **Web application**.
4. Set your authorized redirect URIs (these must match what you register in OpenInt):
   - Format: `https://YOUR_APP_HOST.com/oauth/openint/callback` *(adjust as needed)*
5. Click **Create**. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for use in OpenInt.

## Step 6: Connect Google Docs to OpenInt

1. Log in to your OpenInt dashboard.
2. Add a new Google Docs connector.
3. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the previous step.
4. Specify your required scopes (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`).
5. Save your connector settings.
6. Use the [OpenInt Connect widget](/connect/embed) or backend APIs to generate authentication tokens and allow your users to connect their Google Docs accounts.

## OAuth Scopes: Supported vs. All

Below is a comparison of all relevant Google Docs API scopes and their support status in OpenInt:

| Scope | Description | OpenInt Supported? |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` | <Tooltip text="Provides full read/write access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing, creating, editing, and deleting documents.">Full read/write access to Docs</Tooltip> | ❌ |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly` | <Tooltip text="Provides read-only access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing document content and metadata but no modifications.">Read-only access</Tooltip> | ❌ |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` | <Tooltip text="Provides access to only the files created or opened by this app.">File-level access</Tooltip> | ❌ |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` | <Tooltip text="Provides read-only access to all Google Drive files including Docs.">Drive read-only</Tooltip> | ❌ |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` | <Tooltip text="Provides full read/write access to all Google Drive files including Docs.">Full Drive access</Tooltip> | ❌ |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly` | <Tooltip text="Provides access only to the currently open Google Docs document. Most limited scope for temporary, in-session access.">Current document only</Tooltip> | ✅ |

For more details on scope usage and security, see the [Google Docs API authentication guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth).

## Example: Initiating OAuth with OpenInt

```typescript
import { ConnectEmbed } from '@openint/connect'

// Token generation must occur on your backend (see OpenInt docs)
return <ConnectEmbed token={token} integration="google-docs" />
```

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<Alert type="warning" title="Redirect URI Mismatch">
Make sure the redirect URIs you add in the Google Cloud Console **exactly match** those configured in OpenInt. Any discrepancy will result in OAuth errors.
</Alert>

<Alert type="error" title="Missing or Incorrect Scopes">
If your app requests additional scopes (like `documents` or `drive`), they must be declared on the OAuth consent screen and in both Google Cloud and OpenInt. Unsupported scopes are denied during OAuth.
</Alert>

<Alert type="info" title="Test Users Required">
Google will block sign-in for users not listed as test users until your app is published or verified. Be sure to add all developers and QA testers.
</Alert>

<Alert type="info" title="Sensitive & Restricted Scopes">
Requesting sensitive or restricted scopes triggers Google verification. For most integrations, limit to `documents.currentonly` for the smoothest onboarding.
</Alert>

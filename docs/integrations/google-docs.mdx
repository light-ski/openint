# Google Docs Integration Guide (via OpenInt)

Easily connect your application to Google Docs using OpenInt's prebuilt connector. This guide walks you step-by-step through the OAuth2 setup, required scopes, and best practices for embedding Google Docs access securely in your product.

## Overview

This integration enables your users to securely connect their Google Docs accounts so your app can interact with their Google Docs documents via the official Google Docs API. Use cases include importing/exporting Docs, content sync, and document workflow automation.

- **Audience:** Company A engineers building integrations for business users
- **Integration Stage:** General Availability (`ga`)

---

## Prerequisites

- Access to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- An OpenInt account with integration management permissions
- Your app's deployment domains (required for OAuth Redirect URIs)

# 1. Set Up Google Docs API Credentials

Following the process as outlined in [this reference](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html), you will:

1. **Create or select a Google Cloud project**
2. **Enable the Google Docs API**
3. **Configure the OAuth consent screen**
4. **Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID and Secret)**
5. **Add the required Redirect URI for OpenInt**

<Callout type="info">
<b>Pro Tip:</b> Choose 'Web Application' for OAuth client type, and use the exact Redirect URI provided by OpenInt in your integration dashboard. If your URI doesn't match, Google will reject auth requests.
</Callout>

### Detailed Steps

1. **Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).**
2. **Select your project** or create a new one.
3. **APIs & Services â†’ Library â†’ Search for "Google Docs API" â†’ Enable**
4. **APIs & Services â†’ OAuth consent screen â†’ User Type (choose "External") â†’ Save**
5. **Configure OAuth consent screen:**
   - Add app name, user support email, and developer contact info
   - Add required test users (if in testing mode)
6. **APIs & Services â†’ Credentials â†’ Create Credentials â†’ OAuth client ID**
   - Application Type: "Web Application"
   - Name: (e.g.) `OpenInt Docs Connector`
   - **Authorized Redirect URIs:** Add the URI provided in OpenInt dashboard (e.g. `https://YOUR_OPENINT_HOST/api/oauth/callback/google-docs`)
   - Save to get your Client ID and Client Secret

<Callout type="warning">
<b>Common Mistake:</b> If you use the wrong type (e.g. "Desktop App"), or forget to add the correct Redirect URI, the connection will fail with an "redirect_uri_mismatch" error.
</Callout>

For in-depth instructions, see [this step-by-step guide](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html).

# 2. Configure OpenInt With Google OAuth Credentials

1. Open the OpenInt dashboard for your environment/project.
2. Go to **Integrations â†’ Google Docs**, and select "Configure".
3. Paste in your Google OAuth **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the previous step.
4. Save your configuration.

The OpenInt connector will now use these credentials to initiate OAuth2 handshakes with Google on behalf of your users.

# 3. OAuth Scopes and Permissions

OpenInt uses fine-grained permissions by managing only the scopes listed below. Your app should only request the access level it truly needs for best user trust and faster Google verification.

See the [full Google scopes reference](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth).

## Scope Comparison Table

| Scope URI | Description | Sensitivity | Supported by OpenInt? |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| <Tooltip text="Provides access only to the currently open Google Docs document (when used with Docs add-ons). Most limited scope for temporary access.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`</Tooltip> | Current doc only | Non-sensitive | **âœ… Yes** |
| <Tooltip text="Provides full read/write access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing, creating, editing, and deleting documents.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`</Tooltip> | Full Documents | Sensitive | ðŸš« No |
| <Tooltip text="Provides read-only access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing document content and metadata but no modifications.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`</Tooltip> | Docs Readonly | Sensitive | ðŸš« No |
| <Tooltip text="Provides access to Google Docs files that the app has created or been explicitly granted access to. Limited to specific files rather than all documents.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`</Tooltip> | App-created Files | Non-sensitive | ðŸš« No |
| <Tooltip text="Provides full read/write access to all Google Drive files including Docs. The broadest permission for Docs/Drive operations.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`</Tooltip> | Drive Full Access | Restricted | ðŸš« No |
| <Tooltip text="Provides read-only access to all Google Drive files including Docs, but no modifications allowed. Wider access than drive.file but limited to viewing.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`</Tooltip> | Drive Readonly | Restricted | ðŸš« No |

<Callout type="info">
<b>Need another scope?</b> OpenInt currently enables only `documents.currentonly` for maximum security. If you require broader access, <a href="mailto:support@openint.com">contact support</a> with your use-case and security details.
</Callout>

# 4. OAuth Flow: User Experience

Once configured, users connecting Google Docs via your app using OpenInt will see:

1. **Consent screen** from Google describing access to their Docs (limited to current document)
2. After authorization, users are redirected back to your app and OpenInt securely stores the access token

Your application can now use OpenInt's unified integration APIs to:
- Access active user's currently open document (per `documents.currentonly` scope)
- Refresh tokens as needed (offline access is enabled by default)

---

# 5. Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning">
<b>redirect_uri_mismatch</b> â€“ The most frequent error occurs when the Google OAuth Client configuration lacks the exact Redirect URI used by OpenInt. Double-check the value in your Google developer console.
</Callout>

Other issues & solutions:
- **Invalid OAuth Client Type:** Only "Web Application" types are valid for integrations embedded via OpenInt.
- **Consent Screen Not Approved:** Make sure test users and all required fields are filled out in Google's OAuth consent screen.
- **Scopes Not Approved:** If requesting additional scopes (future expansion), submit for Google review.
- **Organization/Workspace Policies:** Admins may block third-party app access. See [help](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227).

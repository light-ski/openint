# Google Docs Integration Guide

Seamlessly connect your app to Google Docs using OpenInt. This integration enables you to securely access Google Docs functionality on behalf of your users via OAuth 2.0, leveraging a pre-approved set of scopes. This guide walks you through setting up an OAuth Client with Google, configuring it for OpenInt, and avoiding common pitfalls.

## Prerequisites
- A Google account with admin privileges in your organization (for setting up Cloud Projects)
- Access to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Google Cloud Project">
    1. Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
    2. Click on the **Select a project** dropdown at the top, then click **New Project** and follow the prompts to create one, or select an existing suitable project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Google Docs API">
    1. Within your project, click **APIs & Services > Library** in the sidebar.
    2. Search for "Google Docs API" and click **Enable**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth Consent Screen">
    1. In the sidebar, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
    2. For **User Type**, select **External**.
    3. Fill out required fields: Application name, User support email, Developer contact email. Save.
    4. *(Optional but recommended)* Add your domain and branding for a better user experience.
    5. Add yourself and any other necessary email addresses as **Test users** in the consent screen config.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Scopes">
    1. When setting up the consent screen or creating OAuth credentials, you will be prompted to add OAuth scopes.
    2. **For OpenInt, add:**
        - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`
    3. This scope provides access only to the currently open Docs document (most limited, least intrusive). See the [full list and details of Google Docs scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth#docs-scopes) below.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create OAuth Credentials">
    1. In the sidebar, go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    2. Click **+ Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.
    3. Set **Application type**:
        - For most web apps, use **Web application** and set valid redirect URIs to where OpenInt expects callbacks (e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/api/openint/oauth/callback`). Watch out for typos here!
    4. Name your client, then click **Create**.
    5. **Copy your Client ID and Client Secret**—you’ll need both to configure OpenInt.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish App (for Production Use)">
    1. Back under **OAuth consent screen**, click **Publish App** if you're ready for production. (You can continue testing with test users while in 'testing' state.)
    2. **Do not** click "Prepare for Verification" unless you require additional Google review—this is *not* necessary for most internal/business apps and can slow down launch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OpenInt">
    1. Add your **Google Client ID** and **Client Secret** to your OpenInt connector configuration (usually via your secrets environment or .env file).
    2. In OpenInt, specify the scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`.
    3. Deploy or reload OpenInt as needed to pick up new credentials.
    4. Trigger the OAuth connection flow in your application’s UI using OpenInt’s embed or native UI.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Google Docs Scopes

Below is a comparison of scopes supported by the Google Docs API, their descriptions, and which are enabled in OpenInt. All information is also available in the [official docs](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth#docs-scopes).

| Scope                                                                     | Description                                                                                                          | Usage         | Supported in OpenInt |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| <Tooltip tip="Full read/write access to Google Docs.">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents</Tooltip> | See, edit, create, and delete all Google Docs documents.                                                              | Sensitive     | No                  |
| <Tooltip tip="Read-only access to Google Docs.">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly</Tooltip> | See all Google Docs documents (read-only).                                                                           | Sensitive     | No                  |
| <Tooltip tip="Access to app-created/granted Drive files only.">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file</Tooltip> | Access only files your app created or user specifically granted.                                                      | Non-sensitive | No                  |
| <Tooltip tip="Read-only to all Drive files.">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</Tooltip>      | See and download all Drive files (including Docs), read-only.                                                         | Restricted    | No                  |
| <Tooltip tip="Full Drive access, all files.">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</Tooltip>                | See, edit, create, and delete all Drive files.                                                                        | Restricted    | No                  |
| <Tooltip tip="Current Doc only, for add-ons.">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly</Tooltip>  | Provides access only to the currently open Google Docs document (when used via add-ons).                              | Non-sensitive | Yes                 |

<Tip>
  For most use-cases, least-privilege (`documents.currentonly`) is ideal and avoids extra consent screens, app reviews, or verification delays.
</Tip>

## Example Configuration for OpenInt

Place these values in your OpenInt environment, deployment config, or secrets manager:

```env
GOOGLE_DOCS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
GOOGLE_DOCS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
GOOGLE_DOCS_SCOPES=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly
```

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

<Warning>**Missing OAuth Consent Screen setup** – If you haven’t configured and saved the consent screen, Google will block OAuth authorization completely.</Warning>

<Warning>**Wrong Redirect URI** – The redirect URI in your Google credentials _must_ exactly match what OpenInt expects (including protocol, e.g., https). Mismatches are the #1 cause of failed auth.</Warning>

<Warning>**Forgetting test users** – If your app is in “testing” mode, only users listed as test users may authorize. Add yourself or your QA team accordingly.</Warning>

<Note>**Requesting unsupported scopes** – OpenInt’s current implementation allows only the `documents.currentonly` scope. The broader scopes listed above will be silently ignored or rejected. If your workflow demands more, contact OpenInt support.</Note>

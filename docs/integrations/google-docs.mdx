# Google Docs Integration (via OpenInt)

Integrate Google Docs into your app‚Äîsecurely and efficiently‚Äîusing OpenInt's unified OAuth 2.0 flow. This guide covers credential setup, OAuth scope selection, pitfalls, and implementation examples tailored for engineers.

> **Reference:** This integration uses [Google Docs API](https://developers.google.com/docs/api), with a configuration modeled after [2BrightSparks‚Äô OAuth credential walkthrough](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html).

---

## What Does This Integration Enable?

- Secure one-click authentication to a user's Google Docs
- Programmatic access to the user's *currently open* Google Docs document using the **most restrictive available scope**
- Automated data sync, processing, or enrichment in Google Docs (per your app's needs and permissions granted)

To understand how OpenInt connects and flows data, see our [Connector Data Flows](/docs/connect/data-flow.mdx) doc.

## Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Console

Follow these steps to get your Client ID and Client Secret for Google Docs API authentication:

1. **Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).**

2. **Create or Select a Project:**
   - Click the project dropdown (top left), choose or create a new project.

3. **Enable Google Docs API:**
   - Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
   - Search for **Google Docs API** and click **Enable**.

4. **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen:**
   - In the sidebar, find **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
   - Select **External** and click **Create**.
   - Fill required fields (App name, support email, developer contact, etc.).
   - Save and continue.
   - **Add Scopes:**
     - Click **Add or Remove Scopes**.
     - For best compatibility with OpenInt, add: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`
     - (See [scope table](#oauth-scopes) for more details)
   - Add yourself as a test user (unless your app is approved and published).
   - Complete the wizard.

5. **Generate OAuth Client Credentials:**
   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID**.
   - **App type:** Choose **Web application**.
   - Set a name (e.g., "OpenInt Docs Integration").
   - **Authorized redirect URIs:** Enter the URI(s) your OpenInt deployment uses, e.g.:
     - For local/dev: `http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback`
     - For production: `https://your-app.com/oauth/callback`
   - Click **Create**.

6. **Copy Your Client ID and Client Secret:**
   - Copy these. You‚Äôll use them in the OpenInt setup below.

## Step 2: Configure OpenInt With Your Credentials

Add the Google Docs **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to your OpenInt configuration. Typically, this is done via environment variables or your app‚Äôs secret manager. Example:

```env
OPENINT_CONNECTOR_GOOGLEDOCS_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
OPENINT_CONNECTOR_GOOGLEDOCS_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

**Important:**
- The redirect URI you registered *must* match what OpenInt expects. Check your deployment and pass the correct value (see [Connect Embed guide](/docs/connect/embed.mdx)).

## Step 3: OAuth Scopes

Below is a table comparing all available Google Docs API scopes vs. what OpenInt currently supports. Descriptions are included as tooltips for clarity.

| Scope | Description | Supported by OpenInt? |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| <Tooltip content="Provides access only to the currently open Google Docs document (when used with Docs add-ons). Most limited scope for temporary access.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`</Tooltip> | Most restrictive; only access to the user's active Doc. | ‚úÖ **Yes** |
| <Tooltip content="Provides full read/write access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing, creating, editing, and deleting documents.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`</Tooltip> | Full Docs read/write | üö´ No |
| <Tooltip content="Provides read-only access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing document content and metadata but no modifications.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`</Tooltip> | Docs read-only | üö´ No |
| <Tooltip content="Provides access to Google Docs files created by or granted to your app via Drive APIs. Limited to specific files.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`</Tooltip> | Limited per-file access (Drive API) | üö´ No |
| <Tooltip content="Provides full read/write access to all Google Drive files including Docs. The broadest permission for Docs/Drive operations.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`</Tooltip> | Full Drive access | üö´ No |
| <Tooltip content="Provides read-only access to all Google Drive files including Docs, but no modifications allowed. Wider access than drive.file.">`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`</Tooltip> | Drive read-only | üö´ No |

## Step 4: Completing the Integration (‚ÄúHappy Path‚Äù)

1. **Trigger the integration flow** from your app‚Äôs UI (e.g., a ‚ÄúConnect Google Docs‚Äù button).
2. **OpenInt presents the OAuth consent screen** to the user via a browser redirect.
3. **User reviews and grants consent** for the requested scope (`documents.currentonly`).
4. **OpenInt exchanges the code for tokens** and stores the refresh/access tokens securely.
5. **Your backend** can now use OpenInt‚Äôs unified API to perform actions on the currently open Google Doc (per user consent and allowed features).

### Example: Initiating an OAuth Flow with OpenInt SDK

```ts
import { OpenIntClient } from 'openint-sdk';

const openint = new OpenIntClient({
  provider: 'google-docs',
  clientId: process.env.OPENINT_CONNECTOR_GOOGLEDOCS_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.OPENINT_CONNECTOR_GOOGLEDOCS_CLIENT_SECRET,
  redirectUri: 'https://your-app.com/oauth/callback',
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly'],
});

// Generate an auth URL to redirect your user to
const authUrl = openint.getAuthorizationUrl();
```

For the complete flow, see [OpenInt Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart.mdx).

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- <Tooltip content="The Google Docs API must be enabled for your project in Google Cloud Console." placement="top">**Missing API enablement**</Tooltip>: Be sure you enabled Google Docs API (not just Drive API).
- <Tooltip content="The redirect URI you configured in Google Cloud must exactly match the one sent in OpenInt flows.">**Redirect URI mismatch**</Tooltip>: A common OAuth problem‚Äîno typos or trailing slashes.
- <Tooltip content="Scope configured in your Google Cloud project and the scope requested in code must match and be supported by OpenInt.">**Scope mismatch**</Tooltip>: Only `documents.currentonly` is supported by OpenInt for now. Other scopes in Google Docs' API are not yet implemented.
- **Unverified app warnings:** If using sensitive scopes or not yet publishing/verified, you‚Äôll see Google‚Äôs ‚Äúunverified app‚Äù prompt‚Äîthis is expected for initial testing.
- **Test users:** Only users listed as test users in the Consent Screen can authenticate with unpublished apps.
- <Tooltip content="Check your environment variable, config file, secret manager, or deployment environment.">**Credentials not found**</Tooltip>: Double-check env var/config for typos and deployment context.

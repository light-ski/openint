# Integrate Google Docs with OpenInt

This guide walks developers through the process of connecting Google Docs to your application via OpenInt. The integration leverages OAuth2 for secure authentication and granular access control.

Integrate in minutesâ€”manage OAuth credentials, choose the right scopes, and avoid common pitfalls for a seamless Google Docs experience.

---

## Prerequisites
- An [OpenInt Console account](https://app.openint.dev/dashboard/sign-up)
- A [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.developers.google.com/) account with project creation privileges
- (Optional) Access to your organizationâ€™s Google OAuth consent screen or API/identity admin

---

## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Click the project dropdown > **New Project**. Name your project and (optionally) associate it with your org.

<Warning>
If youâ€™ll move this integration to production or use restricted/sensitive scopes, set up billing on your Google project.
</Warning>

---

## Step 2: Configure the OAuth Consent Screen
1. In your project, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
2. Choose **External** (unless you are restricting to internal users on your domain).
3. Fill required fields: app name, user support email, developer contact info.
4. Add all required scopes for the Docs integration *(see scopes table below)*.
5. Add test users (emails that will authenticate your app during development).
   - You can use up to 100 test users before requiring Google verification.
6. Save and continue.

<Warning>
If you use sensitive or restricted scopes, Google requires verification for general use. In the meantime, only test users you specify can connect.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Enable the Google Docs API
1. In the Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
2. Search for "Google Docs API" and click **Enable**.

## Step 4: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
1. In your project, go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
2. Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID**.
3. Set **Application type:** `Web application` (required for OpenInt embeds).
4. **Name** your credential (e.g., "OpenInt Google Docs").
5. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add:
   - `http://localhost:PORT/openint/oauth/callback/google` (for local/test)
   - `https://yourapp.com/openint/oauth/callback/google` (for production)
6. Click **Create**. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**â€”youâ€™ll need these for OpenInt setup.

<Warning>
Mismatch in the redirect URIs (typos, missing trailing slashes, wrong protocol) is the #1 cause of authentication errors (`redirect_uri_mismatch`).
</Warning>

## Step 5: Configure OpenInt for Google Docs
1. Log in to the [OpenInt Console](https://app.openint.dev/dashboard/sign-up).
2. Go to your Connector Configs and select **Google Docs**.
3. Enter your Google **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from earlier.
4. Choose **Docs Scopes** you will use (see table below).
   - For most basic integrations (view/edit open doc), OpenInt supports `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`.
5. Save your configuration.
6. Start the Connect flow in your app (see [Embed guide](/connect/embed)) or generate a [magic link](/core-concepts-v0/magic-link).

## OAuth Scopes Reference

Google Docs provides a variety of OAuth scopesâ€”each grants a different level of access. Always use the minimum required.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Scope</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Sensitivity</th>
      <th>OpenInt Supported?</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Provides access only to the currently open Google Docs document (when used with Docs add-ons). Most limited scope for temporary access.">Most limited scopeâ€”only the current doc, usually via add-ons.</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Non-sensitive</td>
      <td>âœ…</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Provides full read/write access to all Google Docs documents. Allows viewing, creating, editing, and deleting documents.">Full access to all docs (read/write/create/delete).</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Sensitive</td>
      <td>ðŸš«</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Provides read-only access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing document content and metadata but no modifications.">Read-only access to all docs.</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Sensitive</td>
      <td>ðŸš«</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Provides access to Google Docs files the app has created or the user has explicitly opened with the app.">Access to (edit/create/delete) docs/files the app created.</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Non-sensitive</td>
      <td>ðŸš«</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Provides read-only access to all Google Drive files including Docs, but no modifications allowed. Wider access than drive.file but limited to viewing.">Read-only access to all drive files (incl. docs).</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Restricted</td>
      <td>ðŸš«</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</code></td>
      <td><Tooltip content="Provides full read/write access to all Google Drive files including Docs. The broadest permission for Docs/Drive operations.">Full Drive (all files) read/write access.</Tooltip></td>
      <td>Restricted</td>
      <td>ðŸš«</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

- Use the least-privilege scope for your use case.

---

## Typical Happy Path
1. User launches the Connect flow or magic link in your app.
2. Google OAuth screen appearsâ€”user reviews and approves requested scope(s).
3. Upon success, OpenInt completes the integration and your app is notified of the linked Docs account.
4. Your backend can now use OpenInt APIs to interact with the Google Docs account per granted scope (`currentonly` scope = only the currently active/open document).

---

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

- **redirect_uri_mismatch**: Ensure all redirect URIs you use are exactly present in your Google OAuth Client config.
- **Missing or insufficient scopes**: Cross-check your chosen scopes in OpenInt vs what you added to your OAuth Consent screen.
- **Unverified app screen**: Normal for development (test users). For production, submit your app for Google verification if using sensitive scopes.
- **Test user not authorized**: Add all test emails to the OAuth Consent Screen > Test Users list in your GCP project.
- **Quota exceeded / Auth errors**: Use your own Google app credentials; don't share with others.

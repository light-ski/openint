# Integrating Google Docs via OpenInt

This guide describes how to connect your app to Google Docs through OpenInt using OAuth2 authentication. We'll walk through obtaining credentials from Google, configuring the integration in OpenInt, listing all relevant OAuth scopes, and highlighting important troubleshooting steps. This documentation is intended for engineers integrating Google Docs on behalf of their end users.

> **Note:** As of now, OpenInt supports only <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly</code>.<br/>Support for broader Google Docs or Drive scopes may be added in the future. If you plan to extend access, be aware that <b>many scopes require additional Google verification</b> depending on their sensitivity.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- A Google account
- An OpenInt deployment (self-hosted or embedded)

## Step 1: Create Google OAuth2 Credentials

Follow these steps to register your app and obtain the OAuth2 Client ID and Secret required for integration:

1. **Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).**
2. **Select a project** (or create a new one by clicking the project dropdown in the top left and selecting "New Project").
3. **Enable the Google Docs API**:
    - In the left navigation, click **APIs & Services > Library**.
    - Search for "Google Docs API" and click **Enable**.
4. **Configure the OAuth consent screen:**
    - Go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
    - Set **User Type** to "External" and click **Create**.
    - Fill in required fields: **App name**, **User support email**, and **Developer contact email**.
    - Save and continue. (You will add scopes in the next section.)
5. **Add OAuth scopes:**
    - You will be prompted to add scopes. For OpenInt, you should use:
      - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`
    - For details on all available scopes and what they do, see the table below.
    - Save and continue.
6. **Add test users:**
    - Google requires you to add test users (yourself and other developers) before submitting for production.
    - Enter the email addresses and save.
7. **Create OAuth credentials:**
    - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    - Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID**.
    - Choose **Web application** as the application type.
    - Enter a name (e.g., "OpenInt Google Docs Integration").
    - Add the required redirect URI for your OpenInt deployment (consult your OpenInt config for the appropriate value).
    - Click **Create** and copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for use in OpenInt configuration.
8. **Publish the OAuth consent screen** (for production use) or continue in testing mode by restricting access to test users only.

For more detail, you can reference [Google's step-by-step instructions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent) and this [walkthrough example](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html).

## Step 2: Configure OpenInt with OAuth Credentials

You need to provide OpenInt the Client ID and Secret you obtained from Google Cloud Console. This is typically done via your OpenInt secrets/configuration system. Ensure that the redirect URI used in the Google OAuth configuration matches the URI expected by your OpenInt deployment.

Example OpenInt connector config snippet:

```json
{
  "provider": "google-docs",
  "oauth_client_id": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
  "oauth_client_secret": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

Refer to [OpenInt’s integration guide](/docs/getting-started/integrations) for environment-specific setup.

## Supported and Available OAuth Scopes

Below is a list of Google Docs (and related Drive) OAuth scopes. <Badge type="tip">As of now, OpenInt only supports <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly</code>. If you need broader access, review the sensitivity requirements below.</Badge>

  </tbody>
</Table>

If you anticipate needing broader Google Docs or Drive access in the future, review [sensitive and restricted scope requirements](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes):
- <b>Sensitive</b> scopes require additional Google app verification.
- <b>Restricted</b> scopes require security assessment and strict data policy compliance.

For additional details and latest scope information, refer to the [official Google Docs API authorization documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth).

## Common Setup Mistakes & Troubleshooting

- **Incorrect redirect URI**: The redirect URI registered in Google Console must exactly match the one used by your OpenInt deployment.
- **Not enabling the Google Docs API**: Access will fail if you do not enable the API in your Google project.
- **Consent screen misconfiguration**: Missing required user support/developer emails, or failure to add test users, can block authorization.
- **Using unsupported scopes**: OpenInt currently supports only `documents.currentonly`. Attempting broader access will result in authorization errors.
- **Production rollout**: Ensure you publish your consent screen or restrict to "test users" as appropriate for your rollout phase.

If you encounter issues, review the [official troubleshooting resources](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/auth-overview) and double-check all settings.

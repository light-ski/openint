# Google Docs Integration via OpenInt

This guide details how to connect your application to Google Docs using OpenInt’s OAuth2 integration. By following the steps below, Company A’s engineers can enable users to securely link, sync, and interact with Google Docs, leveraging OpenInt’s architecture and user experience.

<Callout type="info">
This document covers **OAuth2 configuration, scope selection, and common troubleshooting**. All steps are designed for experienced software engineers integrating Google Docs as an embedded provider in your app.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- Access to a [Google Cloud project](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- Admin or developer permissions on your Company A/OpenInt integration environment
- A Google account with permission to enable APIs and configure OAuth in your org

---

## Step 1: Set Up a Google Cloud Project & OAuth Credentials

The process closely mirrors the [Google Drive client ID walkthrough](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html), but ensure you enable the **Google Docs API**, not just Google Drive.

1. **Sign in to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).**
2. **Create or select a project.**
3. **Enable the Google Docs API:**
   - In your project, go to `APIs & Services > Library` and search for “Google Docs API”.
   - Click `Enable`.
   - <Callout type="warning">If you do not enable the Docs API, authentication will succeed but API calls will fail with a 403 error.</Callout>
4. **Configure the OAuth consent screen:**
   - Go to `APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen`.
   - Choose **External** (most common), click `Create`.
   - Fill in `App name`, `User support email`, and `Developer contact email`. Save.
   - *Optional*: Add your organization branding or links.
5. **Define scopes:**
   - For OpenInt’s current support, only add `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`. See [Scopes Table](#scopes-table) for details and other options.
6. **Add test users** (if your app is in testing mode): Add your Google account here.
7. **Create OAuth Client ID & Secret:**
   - Go to `APIs & Services > Credentials`.
   - Click `+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID`.
   - Select Application Type: usually **Web application**.
   - Under `Authorized redirect URIs`, add the URI provided by OpenInt (see your OpenInt dashboard or integration guide).
     <Callout type="info">
     Typical pattern: `https://yourapp.com/openint/oauth/callback/google-docs`
     </Callout>
   - Click `Create`. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**—you’ll need these for OpenInt configuration.

---

## Step 2: Configure OpenInt

You will need to provide OpenInt with the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** created above, and configure the scope(s).

1. In your OpenInt dashboard (or integration config file):
    - Enter the OAuth Client ID
    - Enter the OAuth Client Secret
    - Specify the scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`
2. Save your configuration.
3. Trigger the OpenInt connect/auth flow from your app to initiate the OAuth handshake.

---

## Step 3: Test and Validate

1. Start the authentication flow from your Company A application (often a "Connect Google Docs" button powered by OpenInt).
2. Sign in with a Google account authorized as a test user (if applicable).
3. Accept requested permissions. You should only see permissions relating to the scope(s) specified.
4. Upon success, your app will receive access tokens from OpenInt for Google Docs API calls within the selected scope.

<Callout type="success">
If everything is configured properly, you should be able to interact with the current Google Docs document as defined by the `documents.currentonly` scope.
</Callout>

## Scopes Table

The table below outlines all relevant Google Docs API scopes. **OpenInt currently supports only `documents.currentonly`.**

For the authoritative source and the latest scope documentation, refer to [Google Docs API Auth Scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth).

## Common Setup Mistakes & Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning">
Incorrect setup is the most frequent cause of integration/auth failures. See below for solutions.
</Callout>

- **Mismatched redirect URIs:**
   - The redirect URI configured in Google Cloud must exactly match the one specified in your OpenInt/Company A app. Any mismatch will cause OAuth to error out with a `redirect_uri_mismatch` error.
- **Not enabling the Google Docs API:**
   - Google authentication will succeed but API calls will return a 403 error if the API is not enabled.
- **Trying to use unsupported scopes:**
   - OpenInt currently supports only `documents.currentonly`. Requests for other scopes will be rejected or ignored.
- **Not adding your Google login as a test user:**
   - If in "Testing" mode, your account must be added as a test user or you’ll see an authorization error.
- **Not publishing OAuth consent screen:**
   - Unpublished consent screens may prevent real user auth.

If you encounter errors, review the above, and consult the [Google Docs API Auth Guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth).

# Google Docs Integration (via OpenInt)

Integrate Google Docs into your app using OpenInt's secure OAuth2 connector. This guide explains how to set up, configure, and use the Google Docs integration, including all necessary Google Cloud Console steps and supported scope details.

## Overview

The Google Docs integration allows your application to:

- Read, edit, and create Docs (subject to granted scopes)
- Connect using your own Google Cloud credentials via standard OAuth 2.0 flows
- Leverage OpenInt for user authentication and granular scope management

## Prerequisites

- Access to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- Permission to create/configure projects
- OpenInt admin access or ability to update integration secrets (client ID/secret)
- Your OpenInt environment set up (see [getting started](../getting-started/quickstart))

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Callout type="info">
This process is modeled on Google's best practices and follows [this 2BrightSparks article](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html). It closely mirrors steps for enabling Google Drive, but applies to Google Docs.
</Callout>

### 1. Create (or select) a Google Cloud project
Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). Select an existing project or create a new one for integration.

### 2. Enable the Google Docs API
Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**. Search for "Google Docs API" and click **Enable**.

### 3. Configure the OAuth consent screen
1. In the left menu, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
2. Choose **External**.
3. Fill in:
   - **App name**
   - **User support email**
   - **Developer contact information**
   - You can leave other fields empty for testing; fill out as required for production.
4. Click **Save and Continue**.
5. Add yourself/your testers as test users during development.

### 4. Add OAuth Scopes

When prompted, add one or more of the following required scopes. 

:::tip
Only one scope is currently supported by OpenInt for Google Docs:
```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly
```
Additional scopes will be supported in future updates (see table below).
:::

For reference, all possible Google Docs and related scopes are listed in the **Supported OAuth Scopes** section below, with descriptions.

### 5. Create OAuth Client Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials** > **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** > **OAuth client ID**.
2. For most backend integrations, use **Web application** (or Desktop if you're building a local/internal tool).
3. Specify an **Authorized redirect URI**. This must match exactly what OpenInt expects. For example:

```
https://YOUR_OPENINT_HOST/callback/google-docs
```

Check your OpenInt configuration for the actual required redirect URI—you must match it exactly (including trailing slashes if present).

<Callout type="warning">
If your redirect URI does not match **exactly** during Google OAuth setup, you will get a `redirect_uri_mismatch` error.
</Callout>

4. Click **Create**. Copy both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### 6. Configure Credentials in OpenInt

Add the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for Google Docs integration to your OpenInt configuration (via dashboard, environment variable, or secret manager according to your setup). See [OpenInt Getting Started](../getting-started/quickstart) if you're unsure how to do this.

## Supported OAuth Scopes

Below is a table of all known Google Docs (and related Drive) OAuth scopes. Only the `documents.currentonly` scope is currently usable with OpenInt—others may be requested for future support.

For the most up-to-date list, see [Google's official scope documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth#docs-scopes).

      <td>❌ Not yet supported</td>
      <td>Restricted</td>
    </tr>

</table>

:::info
Using fewer/more limited scopes improves user confidence and reduces verification burden. Choose only those your app actually needs.

## Using the Google Docs Integration in Your App

Once properly configured, you can use the OpenInt integration to connect individual user accounts to Google Docs. In most cases you will:

1. Trigger the OAuth2 flow via your app or OpenInt's embeddable UI.
2. User authenticates with Google, approves requested scope(s).
3. Your backend receives and stores the OAuth tokens (OpenInt abstracts token refresh).
4. You can now interact with the granted user's Google Docs via OpenInt APIs.

Example config (abstract):
```typescript
const openInt = new OpenIntClient({
  connector: 'google-docs',
  clientId: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID',
  clientSecret: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET',
  // ...
})
// See OpenInt core integration docs for usage examples
```

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

| Error | Typical Cause | Resolution |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| `redirect_uri_mismatch` | Redirect URI in Google Console does not match OpenInt config | Check both for typos, trailing/leading slashes, protocol, etc. |
| `invalid_scope` | Adding scopes not yet supported by OpenInt, or typo in scope URI | Use only supported scopes. See table above. |
| Consent screen not showing app info | Incorrect setup in consent screen, or not published | Complete all required fields, publish for production |
| 403 or quota errors | Incorrect project, not whitelisted as test user, quota exceeded | Ensure correct Cloud project, add test user, check quotas |

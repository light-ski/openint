# Google Docs Integration (via OpenInt)

This guide will show you how to enable Google Docs integration for your application using OpenInt. It covers every step -- from registering OAuth credentials with Google, through configuring OpenInt, to understanding and selecting the right API scopes.

> **Who is this for?**
> OpenInt enables developers to provide seamless Google Docs connectivity to their users. This document is written for engineers at organizations (like Company A) embedding or managing integration logic using OpenInt.

## Prerequisites
- A Google account with permission to create projects in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
- An OpenInt deployment in your environment.
- Admin access to your app's configuration (to input OAuth keys/secrets).

---

## 1. Register Your Application and Get OAuth Credentials

Follow these step-by-step instructions (modeled after [2BrightSparks‚Äô developer guide](https://www.2brightsparks.com/resources/articles/gdriveclientid.html)) to obtain Google OAuth credentials:

1. Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. **Create or Select a Project:**
    - Use the ‚ÄúSelect a project‚Äù dropdown, or click **New Project** if setting up for the first time.
3. **Enable the Google Docs API:**
    - In your project dashboard, click **+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES**.
    - Search for `Google Docs API` and click **Enable**.
    - *(Optionally, also enable Google Drive API for richer document/file access.)*
4. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen:**
    - In the sidebar, go to **OAuth consent screen**.
    - Choose **External** (for most cases), then **Create**.
    - Fill in required fields (app name, support email, developer contact, etc.), then **Save and Continue**.
    - Add yourself (or any testers) as Test Users, then **Save and Continue**.
5. **Create OAuth Client Credentials:**
    - In the sidebar, go to **Credentials**.
    - Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** > **OAuth client ID**.
    - Application Type: **Web application**.
    - Enter a name (e.g. `OpenInt Google Docs Integration`).
    - **Authorized Redirect URIs:** Add the OpenInt redirect URI for your environment (e.g., `https://YOUR_OPENINT_DOMAIN/oauth/callback`).
    - Click **Create**.
    - Copy the resulting **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Store these securely and keep them confidential.
6. **(Optional) Publish Application:**
    - If you need external (non-tester) users to authenticate, publish the app on the consent screen.
    - For internal or limited usage, keeping the app in testing mode suffices.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tip**: Always keep your client secret safe. Never expose it in client-side code.

## 2. Configure OpenInt with Google OAuth Credentials

Embed your credentials into OpenInt. Generally, you‚Äôll use an environment variable or connector-specific configuration. Example (YAML):

```yaml
OPENINT_CONNECTORS:
  google-docs:
    client_id: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
    client_secret: <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
    # Add additional required fields, such as redirect_uri if required.
```

Or in code:

```typescript
const googleDocsConfig = {
  clientId: '<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>',
  clientSecret: '<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>',
  redirectUri: 'https://YOUR_OPENINT_DOMAIN/oauth/callback',
  scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly'], // See scope options below
};
```

> **Warning**: The only Google Docs scope currently supported by OpenInt is `documents.currentonly`. If your integration requires more access, open a feature request with OpenInt support.

## 3. Supported and Upstream OAuth Scopes

The Google Docs and Drive APIs provide multiple OAuth scopes. Most allow granular control over "read/write" vs. "read-only" and per-file/document permissions. 

**OpenInt currently supports:**
- [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth) ‚Äì <MintlifyTooltip label="What is this?">Limited to the currently open Google Docs document (when used with Docs add-ons). Most restricted and safest scope for short-lived access.</MintlifyTooltip>

**Other Google Docs/Drive API scopes available, but not yet implemented in OpenInt:**

| Scope                                               | Description | Supported by OpenInt? |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth)         | <MintlifyTooltip label="View details">Provides full read/write access to Google Docs documents. Allows viewing, creating, editing, and deleting documents.</MintlifyTooltip> | ‚ùå |
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth) | <MintlifyTooltip label="View details">Read-only access to Docs. Allows viewing document content/metadata but not editing.</MintlifyTooltip> | ‚ùå |
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth)         | <MintlifyTooltip label="View details">Accesses Google Drive files this app created/has access to ‚Äì more limited than full Drive scope.</MintlifyTooltip> | ‚ùå |
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth)     | <MintlifyTooltip label="View details">Read-only access to **all** Google Drive files.</MintlifyTooltip> | ‚ùå |
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth)              | <MintlifyTooltip label="View details">Full read/write access to **all** Google Drive files (including Docs, Sheets, and more).</MintlifyTooltip> | ‚ùå |

For the authoritative list and descriptions, see the [Google Docs API OAuth Scopes documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth#docs-scopes).

> üõ† **Tip:** Use the narrowest scope your use case allows!

## 4. Start the OAuth Flow via OpenInt

Once credentials and scopes are set, initiate the OAuth process through OpenInt:

- Direct users to OpenInt‚Äôs Google Docs connect endpoint (see your OpenInt dashboard or API reference)
- User will be redirected to Google‚Äôs login page with a consent screen
- On confirmation, Google will return an authorization code which OpenInt will exchange for access tokens
- OpenInt will manage tokens/refresh behind-the-scenes

If the configured redirect URI or client credentials are invalid, Google will display an error. Double-check your Cloud Console settings!

## 5. Common Mistakes and Troubleshooting

- **OAuth Consent Errors:**
    - Cause: Missing/incorrect app info, or not added as test user.
- **Redirect URI Mismatch:**
    - Make sure the URI in your Google console matches what OpenInt sends.
- **Client ID/Secret Issues:**
    - Invalid/expired credentials; regenerate and update them in OpenInt.
- **Scope Errors:**
    - Attempting to use scopes not implemented in OpenInt.
- **Limited Permissions:**
    - Only `documents.currentonly` is enabled now. For broader permissions, contact OpenInt support.
- **Google API Quota Limits:**
    - Use your own Google OAuth keys to avoid global/shared rate limits.

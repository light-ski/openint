# Instagram Integration (Business)

Integrate Instagram (business accounts) into your product via OpenInt, allowing your users to connect, sync, and access Instagram business data securely. This guide explains how to add Instagram as a connector using OpenInt, details on configuration and OAuth, the supported scopes, and common pitfalls when working with the Instagram Graph API.

## Quickstart Setup

1. **Register a Meta (Facebook) developer account** if you haven't already: [Register as a Meta Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/register/)

2. **Create a new Meta App:**
   - Go to the [Meta App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select `Create App`.
   - Choose **Business** as the app type to add the Instagram product ([official Meta docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-platform/create-an-instagram-app/#step-4--select-your-app-type)).
   - Enter your app name and contact details.
   - **Connect a verified Meta Business** to your app. ([Learn more](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release/business-verification/))

3. **Add the Instagram product:**
   - In your app dashboard, scroll to **Instagram** and click `Set up`.
   - Choose `API setup with Instagram login` if your users will log in with Instagram directly, or `API setup with Facebook login` for Instagram creator/business accounts linked to Facebook Pages.

4. **Configure OAuth credentials:**
   - In your app's dashboard, go to **Settings > Basic** to find your `App ID` and `App Secret` (these are your OAuth client ID/secret).
   - Under **Instagram > Business Login Settings**, add your OAuth Redirect URI as provided by OpenInt in your developer console.
   - Set up any required deauthorize or data deletion callback URLs as needed.

5. **Configure OpenInt:**
   - In your OpenInt dashboard or config, add a new connector with the client ID and client secret from your Meta app.
   - Ensure you specify the required scope (`instagram_basic`).
   - The authorization request URL is: `https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize`
   - The token request URL is: `https://api.instagram.com/oauth/access_token`

6. **Test the connection** with Instagram accounts that are public and have at least one media object.

## Supported OAuth Scopes

OpenInt currently supports the minimum Instagram business scopeâ€”`instagram_basic`. Other Instagram scopes are not yet available via OpenInt, but are listed here for completeness:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| <Tooltip tip="Provides basic access to a user's profile information, username, and profile picture. This is the most limited scope.">instagram_basic</Tooltip> | **Supported by OpenInt** |
| <Tooltip tip="Provides access to the user's profile information including username, profile picture, and account type (Business or Personal).">user_profile</Tooltip> | *Not yet supported* |
| <Tooltip tip="Provides access to the user's media (photos and videos) including metadata, captions, and comments.">user_media</Tooltip> | *Not yet supported* |
| <Tooltip tip="Provides access to the list of Instagram Pages a user manages. Required for accessing Page-related features.">pages_show_list</Tooltip> | *Not yet supported* |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows the app to publish content (photos and videos) on behalf of the user.">instagram_content_publish</Tooltip> | *Not yet supported* |
| <Tooltip tip="Allows the app to read and manage comments on the user's media.">instagram_manage_comments</Tooltip> | *Not yet supported* |
| <Tooltip tip="Provides access to business account insights and metrics.">instagram_manage_insights</Tooltip> | *Not yet supported* |
| <Tooltip tip="Provides access to manage ads and campaigns for Instagram business accounts.">ads_management</Tooltip> | *Not yet supported* |

## Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting

- **Incorrect app type or missing business verification:** Instagram integration requires a *Business* type Meta app connected to a verified Meta Business account.
- **Missing allowed redirect URI:** The OAuth redirect URI configured in Meta must _exactly_ match the one provided by OpenInt, otherwise authentication will fail.
- **Personal Instagram accounts are not supported:** Only business or creator accounts are supported for API access.
- **Insufficient scopes:** Make sure `instagram_basic` is requested. Extra scopes not supported by OpenInt will not be granted.
- **App review requirements:** For production access and elevated scopes, your app must pass Meta's App Review, including screencasts showing permission use.
- **Account has no media:** Test accounts must have at least one public media object for full API access.
- **Token or authentication failures:** Double-check your client ID/secret, scope, and that your app is in development mode with correct test users assigned.

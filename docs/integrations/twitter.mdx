# Twitter Integration (OAuth 2.0)

Integrate Twitter with your application using OpenInt’s OAuth 2.0 connector. This guide walks developers through setup, supported scopes, best practices, and troubleshooting for the Twitter integration.

## Overview

- **Audience:** Developer / Technical
- **Vertical:** Social Media
- **Status:** General Availability (GA)
- **Auth:** OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code

---

## Prerequisites

- A [Twitter Developer Platform](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) account and access to the Developer Portal.
- An OpenInt project configured.

---

## Step 1: Obtain Twitter OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. **Create a Twitter Developer App:**
   - Visit the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).
   - Click **Create App** and provide required details (App name, description, etc.).
2. **Configure App Permissions:**
   - For OAuth 2.0, configure your app under the **User authentication settings**.
   - Ensure your app enables OAuth 2.0 and supplies a valid callback URL (match this with your OpenInt environment).
3. **Retrieve Client ID and Client Secret:**
   - After saving, you will be shown a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** – copy these securely for your OpenInt configuration.

**Official Guide:** See [Twitter: OAuth 2.0 User Access Tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token)

---

## Step 2: Configure Twitter Integration in OpenInt

Configure OpenInt with the Client ID and Client Secret you obtained.

```ts
// Example (pseudocode)
openint.connectors.twitter.configure({
  clientId: "YOUR_TWITTER_CLIENT_ID",
  clientSecret: "YOUR_TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET",
  redirectUri: "YOUR_CALLBACK_URL",
  scopes: ["offline.access"], // Only offline.access currently supported
});
```

The `redirectUri` should match one of the callback URLs in your Twitter app settings.

## Supported OAuth 2.0 Scopes

Below is a comparison of all Twitter OAuth 2.0 user access scopes, indicating which are currently supported by OpenInt. [See Twitter Scope Docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/user-access-token)

| Scope            | Description                                                                                                                                               | Supported by OpenInt |
|------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------:|
| offline.access   | <span title="Allows the application to obtain a refresh token that can be used to request new access tokens without user interaction.">Obtain refresh tokens for long-term access.</span> |       ✅              |
| tweet.read       | <span title="Read Tweets and Retweets from people you follow and your own.">Read Tweets</span>                                                            |       ❌              |
| tweet.write      | <span title="Post and delete Tweets for you.">Post/Delete Tweets</span>                                                                                   |       ❌              |
| users.read       | <span title="Read profile information (including followers, following, etc.) of you and people you follow.">Read Profiles</span>                          |       ❌              |
| follows.read     | <span title="See who you follow.">View Following</span>                                                                                                   |       ❌              |
| follows.write    | <span title="Follow and unfollow people for you.">Manage Following</span>                                                                                 |       ❌              |
| like.read        | <span title="See Tweets you’ve liked and who liked your Tweets.">Read Likes</span>                                                                        |       ❌              |
| like.write       | <span title="Like and unlike Tweets for you.">Manage Likes</span>                                                                                        |       ❌              |

## Step 3: Quickstart – Initiating OAuth Flow

Below is a typical flow for integrating Twitter with OpenInt.

```ts
// Example: Initiate OAuth 2.0 flow
const url = openint.connectors.twitter.getAuthorizationUrl();
// Redirect user to `url`, handle redirectUri in your app to complete OAuth2 exchange
```

On successful completion, you’ll receive access and refresh tokens.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

> **Callback URL Mismatch**: Ensure your callback (redirect) URL in OpenInt and in the Twitter developer app configuration exactly match. Twitter is strict on this.

> **Missing Permissions**: Twitter will reject scopes in your OAuth request that are not enabled for your app, or not supported by OpenInt.

> **Inactive App or Keys**: Expired, revoked, or misconfigured Twitter credentials will fail authentication. Regenerate keys if you suspect issues.

> **Only `offline.access` Supported**: Attempting to request additional permissions will result in a scope error. OpenInt currently exposes only the `offline.access` scope for Twitter.

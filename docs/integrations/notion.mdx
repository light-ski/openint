# Notion Integration (Developer Guide)

This guide explains how to connect Notion to your application using OpenInt via OAuth 2.0. It includes Notion app registration, OAuth setup, supported scopes (capabilities), and common configuration pitfalls.

## Overview

OpenInt supports integrating Notion using the [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) public integration flow. At present, only the `user:read` capability is supported (see [Scopes](#notion-scopes-capabilities)).

**Status:** General Availability (GA)

**Vertical:** Wiki / Collaboration

**OAuth Type:** Public (Authorization Code Flow)

---

## Quickstart

Follow these steps to get up and running:

### 1. Register a Public Integration in Notion

1. Visit the [Notion integrations dashboard](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) and click **+ New integration**.
2. Choose **Public** integration. Fill in your information.
3. Add your OpenInt callback URL as a **Redirect URI** (`redirect_uri`).
4. Submit. Copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

See: [Create a Notion Integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration)

### 2. Configure OpenInt Notion Connector

```json title="Sample OpenInt Notion Connector Configuration"
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "OAUTH2",
    "authorization_request_url": "https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/authorize",
    "token_request_url": "https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/token",
    "scope_separator": " ",
    "params_config": {"authorize": {"response_type": "code", "owner": "user"}},
    "client_id": "<your-client-id>",
    "client_secret": "<your-client-secret>",
    "redirect_uri": "<your-redirect-uri>",
    "scopes": ["user:read"]
  }
}
```

Replace `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_uri` with your values from Notion. The redirect URI **must** exactly match your Notion configuration.

## OAuth 2.0 Flow

OpenInt implements Notion’s public OAuth flow:

1. **Send user to the authorization URL:**

    ```text
    https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&owner=user
    ```
2. **User selects pages to share with your integration in the Notion prompt.**
3. **On approval, Notion redirects to your URI** with a `code` parameter.
4. **Exchange code for a token** at [`/v1/oauth/token`](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#step-3-send-the-code-in-a-post-request-to-the-notion-api) using your client credentials.
5. **Store the resulting access token** for use in API calls for that user.

See full flow: [Authorization Guide](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up).

## Notion Scopes (Capabilities)

Notion controls access via integration "capabilities" (scopes). **Currently, OpenInt supports only `user:read`.**

See [official capabilities list](https://developers.notion.com/reference/capabilities) for authoritative details.

| Scope/Capability         | Description                                                                                                                                                           | Supported by OpenInt |

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

- **Redirect URI mismatch:** The redirect URI set in OpenInt *must* exactly match the value set in your Notion app. Typos or mismatches are a top source of errors.
- **Missing scopes:** Only `user:read` is supported by OpenInt. Requesting other scopes will not grant broader access.
- **Notion access not granted:** Users _must_ select the Notion pages/databases to share during consent. Your application cannot access pages unless they are explicitly shared.
- **Misconfigured client credentials:** Double check that your client ID and secret are correct and in the right fields.
- **Permission errors:** Usually indicate pages were not shared or you're missing required scopes.

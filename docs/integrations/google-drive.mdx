# Google Drive Integration

Embed Google Drive integration into your application using OpenInt. This guide is for software engineers looking to enable their end users to connect and sync data with Google Drive via a white-labeled integration. The connector is production-ready (GA) and supports use cases across wiki and file-storage verticals.

---

## Quickstart

**1. Prerequisites**

- [ ] You have OpenInt integrated with your application.
- [ ] You have access to a [Google Cloud Console project](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- [ ] You are familiar with OAuth 2.0 basics ([docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)).

**2. Register Your OAuth App with Google**

1. Open the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. Create a new project (or select an existing one).
3. Enable the **Google Drive API** for your project.
   - In the left menu, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
   - Search for **Google Drive API** and enable it.
4. Configure the OAuth consent screen:
   - In **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**, specify the application name, authorized domain, and user-facing information as required. **Publish** your consent screen for production use.
5. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.
   - Select **Web Application** as the application type.
   - Set the authorized redirect URI to the value provided by your OpenInt deployment. (Example: `https://your-app.com/openint/oauth/callback`)
   - Save and note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** securely.

**3. Configure OpenInt With Google OAuth Credentials**

Supply the Google OAuth Client ID and Client Secret to OpenInt. For example (pseudo-code):

```env
OPENINT_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
OPENINT_GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

**4. Set Required OAuth Scope**

For the current OpenInt connector:

```env
OPENINT_GOOGLE_DRIVE_SCOPES="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly"
```

**5. Test the Integration**

Trigger the OpenInt Connect flow for Google Drive. Authenticate using a test Google account. After consent, confirm metadata is retrieved from Google Drive.

## How OAuth 2.0 Works With Google Drive

Google Drive uses [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) to let users grant fine-grained API access to their documents and drive data. Auth flows supported by OpenInt use the Authorization Code grant type for security and refresh token support.

Key parameters set by OpenInt:

- `response_type=code`
- `access_type=offline` (refresh tokens enabled)
- `prompt=consent` (forces consent screen)

Make sure redirect URIs in Google Cloud match those used by your OpenInt instance.

## Google Drive OAuth Scopes

Google Drive offers several OAuth scopes, each providing a different level of access. OpenInt currently supports only a subset. See the table below for details and supported status:

<!-- Table using Mintlify's standard Markdown and tooltips as described in their documentation -->

| Scope | Description | OpenInt Supported? |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth) | <Tooltip text="Full, permissive scope to access all of a user's Drive files, including read, write, and delete.">Full Drive access</Tooltip> | No |
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth) | <Tooltip text="Access to files created by or opened with your app. No access to other user's Drive files by default.">App-created/opened files</Tooltip> | No |
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth) | <Tooltip text="Access to the application's hidden appdata folder in Drive.">AppData folder</Tooltip> | No |
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth) | <Tooltip text="Read/write access to all Drive file metadataâ€”but not file contents.">Read/write Drive file metadata</Tooltip> | No |
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth) | <Tooltip text="Read-only access to Drive file/folder metadata. Cannot access content.">Read-only Drive file metadata</Tooltip> | Yes |
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth) | <Tooltip text="Read all files and metadata in the user's Drive.">Read-only all files and metadata</Tooltip> | No |
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.scripts`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth) | <Tooltip text="Read, edit, create, or delete user's Apps Script projects on Drive.">Apps Script projects</Tooltip> | No |
| [`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.photos.readonly`](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth) | <Tooltip text="Read-only access to user's Google Photos stored in Drive.">Photos readonly</Tooltip> | No |

For the complete and up-to-date scopes list, refer to [Google's official documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth).

## Common Integration Mistakes

- **Incorrect Redirect URI**: Redirect URI specified in Google Cloud Console must *precisely* match what OpenInt provides; mismatches cause OAuth errors.
- **Drive API not enabled**: Ensure "Google Drive API" is enabled in your Google Cloud project.
- **OAuth consent screen not set up or not published**: Your OAuth consent screen must be fully configured and "In production". Otherwise, user accounts outside your org may be unable to complete authentication.
- **Incorrect scope set**: OpenInt currently supports only `drive.metadata.readonly`. Using another scope will fail.
- **Client Secret exposed**: Never commit secrets to public repos; use environment variables or secure vaults.
- **User didn't consent to all requested scopes**: Ensure the exact scope(s) required by OpenInt are requested and described in the consent screen.

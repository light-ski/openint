# Connect Your GitHub Account

You can securely connect your GitHub account to {{APP_NAME}} to unlock powerful collaboration and automation features. Connecting is quick and safe, and you can control what information is shared.

## How to Connect

1. **Go to your Integrations page** in {{APP_NAME}}.
2. Select **GitHub** from the integration options.
3. Click **Connect GitHub**. You will be redirected to GitHub’s secure login page.
4. Log in to GitHub (if you aren’t already logged in).
5. Review the permissions requested by {{APP_NAME}} and click **Authorize** to complete the connection.

Your account will return to {{APP_NAME}}, and setup will complete automatically. That’s it — your GitHub account is now linked!

## What Permissions Are Needed (and Why)

When connecting, {{APP_NAME}} requests the following permissions from GitHub. These are required for various integration features (such as syncing, automation, or reporting):

| Permission | Why It’s Needed |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **user:email**    | View your email addresses to associate activity with your account, and send notifications. |
| **read:user**     | Access your public profile to personalize your experience in {{APP_NAME}}.                    |
| **repo**          | Full access to code, issues, and repo settings, enabling deeper collaboration and automation. |
| **repo:status**   | Update repository commit status, e.g., marking CI tests as passing or failing.                |
| **admin:org**     | Manage organization settings if you choose to connect at the org level.                       |
| **write:discussion** | Read or create team discussions directly from {{APP_NAME}}.                               |
| **workflow**      | Manage GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD automations.                                       |

*You can always review or revoke these permissions within your GitHub account settings.*

## How to Test That the Connection Works

Once you’ve connected GitHub:

- You will see a **Connected** status next to GitHub in your integrations list.
- Try syncing data, creating an issue, or viewing repository info from {{APP_NAME}} — it should work instantly.

If actions succeed, your integration is active!

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

Most users connect on the first try, but here are a few things to watch for:

- **Authorization Denied:** If you decline permissions on GitHub, the connection will not complete. You can restart from the integration screen.
- **Insufficient Permissions:** If you only grant partial permissions, some features (e.g., organization or repo actions) may not work.
- **Organization Admin Approval Needed:** For org-wide integrations, an organization owner may need to approve access.
- **Connection Revoked:** If you revoke permissions in GitHub, reconnect from the Integrations page to restore functionality.
- **Stale Session:** If your GitHub login has expired, simply log in again when prompted.

If you still have trouble, check your GitHub account settings under **Applications** or contact {{APP_NAME}} support for help.

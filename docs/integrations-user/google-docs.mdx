## Permissions requested

<Callout type="info" title="Why do we need these permissions?">
We request these permissions so Company A can work with your Google Docs documents and related files—enabling you to manage, create, and sync documents securely through your Google account.
</Callout>

| Permission Scope | Access Details |
|---|---|
| **Full Google Docs access**<br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | View, create, edit, and delete Google Docs. Required for full editing and sync features. |
| **Read-only Docs**<br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | View content and metadata of your Docs (no changes allowed). Selected if you only need to view documents. |
| **App-created Drive files only**<br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Access to files created by Company A or that you explicitly share with Company A. Most limited file-level permission. |
| **Read-only Google Drive**<br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | View Drive files (including Docs) without modifying them. |
| **Full Google Drive**<br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | View, edit, create, and delete any files on your Drive (including Docs). Required for advanced features. |
| **Current Doc only**<br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Temporary access to only the document you’re currently working with. Used for very limited, session-based features. |

> _The exact permissions you are asked for may depend on your chosen settings during integration setup._

## Testing the integration

After connecting, you can verify the integration works by:

- Navigating to the Integrations page in Company A: The Google Docs status should show "Connected".
- Trying to import or sync a Google Doc within Company A.
- Creating or updating a document via Company A, then confirming changes appear in your Google Docs account.

If everything works, you’re all set!

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning" title="Having trouble connecting?">
Here are some tips if you’re having issues:
</Callout>

- **Authentication Failed**: Double-check that you are using the correct Google account and that you’ve completed the consent process.
- **Insufficient Permissions**: If you declined any requested permissions, the connection may not work fully. Reconnect and accept all needed permissions.
- **Not seeing your Docs**: Ensure the correct account is connected, and that you have granted access to the necessary files (especially if using limited permissions scopes like `drive.file`).
- **Connection unexpectedly disconnected**: Your consent may expire over time. Repeating the steps above to reconnect will restore access.
- **Still having issues?** Try logging out from both Google and Company A, then starting the connection process again.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can Company A view or edit all my Google Drive files?**

A: Only if you grant the broadest permission (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`). With more limited scopes, Company A only accesses files it creates or you explicitly share.

**Q: Can I disconnect my account later?**

A: Yes! You can disconnect Google Docs anytime from Company A’s integrations page. After disconnecting, Company A will no longer have access to your Google Docs or Drive files.

**Q: What happens to my documents if I disconnect?**

A: Company A will lose access to your Google Docs. Any documents already synced or imported will remain, but updates will no longer sync.

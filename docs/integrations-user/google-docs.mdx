<Callout type="info">
You can choose to grant only the permissions required for your use case. Company A will never access more than what you approve during the connection process.
</Callout>

## Test Your Connection

To confirm your integration is working:

1. Go to any feature in Company A that uses Google Docs (e.g., document syncing, import).
2. Try syncing or viewing a Google Doc.
3. If the document loads successfully, your connection is active.

If you have any issues, try disconnecting and reconnecting Google Docs, or see troubleshooting below.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

<Callout type="warning">
**Pop-up blocked:** If nothing happens when you click <b>Connect</b>, your browser may have blocked the sign-in window. Enable pop-ups for Company A and try again.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Wrong Account:** If you connect the wrong Google account, disconnect and repeat the process with the desired account.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Permission denied:** If you didn’t grant all requested permissions or see an error stating access was denied, disconnect and reconnect, ensuring you approve the required permissions.
</Callout>

If you continue to have trouble, contact Company A’s support team for help.

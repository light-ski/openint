## What Permissions Are Requested?

When connecting, Company A only requests the permissions necessary for syncing documents and features you activate. You will see a summary in Google’s popup before allowing access.

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **View and manage Google Docs documents**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Lets Company A view, create, edit, and delete your Google Docs documents. Required for full sync, editing, and document management. |
| **View Google Docs documents only**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | Allows Company A to read your document contents and metadata without making changes. |
| **Access only specific Drive files**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Grants access only to the Google Docs you’ve created via Company A (or explicitly selected), not your entire Google Drive. |
| **View all Google Drive files (read-only)**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Allows Company A to list and read your Drive files, including Docs, but without any changes. |
| **View and manage all Google Drive files**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Grants the broadest access: Company A may view, create, modify, and delete any file in your Drive (including Docs). Only used for advanced features. |
| **Only current document access**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Restricts Company A to just the Google Docs file you’re actively working on. Limited-use for document add-ons. |

<Callout type="warning">
For your security, you should only grant permissions you’re comfortable with. Company A will only use the minimum necessary to provide the requested features.
</Callout>

## Test Your Connection

After connecting:

- Open your document list in Company A and verify your Google Docs appear.
- Try creating a new doc—check if it shows up in your Google Drive.
- Open, update, or view a Docs file from within the dashboard.

If these work, you’re all set!

## Troubleshooting

If you have trouble connecting:

- **Wrong account?** Log out of extra Google accounts in your browser. Try the connection again with only your preferred Google Account signed in.
- **Permissions denied?** The integration only works if you accept the requested permissions. If you missed a step, disconnect and try again.
- **Popup not showing?** Browser popups must be enabled for Company A. Check your browser's popup settings.
- **General issues?** Try refreshing your browser, or sign out and back in to both Google and Company A.

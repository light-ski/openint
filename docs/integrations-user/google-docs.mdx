## What Permissions Are Requested?

When you connect your Google Docs account, you’ll be asked to grant certain permissions to Company A. Here’s a summary of what’s requested and why:

| Permission | Why This is Needed |
| --- | --- |
| **View and manage your Google Docs documents**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Allows Company A to display, create, edit, and delete documents on your behalf. |
| **View only your Google Docs documents**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | Lets Company A access and display document contents without making changes. |
| **Access files created or specifically shared with Company A**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Allows use of documents/files the app creates or you explicitly grant access to—limiting exposure of your other files. |
| **View all your Google Drive files (read-only)**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Lets Company A view, but not change, all files in your Drive, including Docs files. |
| **View and manage all your Google Drive files**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Enables full access to all Drive files to support advanced document workflows. |
| **Access only the currently open Google Docs document**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Restricts access to only the Docs file you’re currently working on for temporary or limited actions. |

You may be prompted to accept one or more of these permissions depending on the features you use in Company A. Granting access allows Company A to sync, read, or update documents as required for your workflow. See Google’s [official permission guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth) for further details.

## How to Verify and Use Your Connection

- After connecting, your Google Docs should become available in your Company A workspace.
- Create, view, or sync documents to ensure the connection is working.
- If you encounter issues, try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Callout type="caution">
If you see an "Access Denied" error, or you denied permissions during the Google sign-in process, you can retry the connection by clicking **Connect Google Docs** again and accepting all requested permissions.

# Connect Google Docs to Your Account

Easily connect your Google Docs account to start importing, exporting, and syncing your documents with this app. The process is fast and secure—your privacy and document safety are protected at all times.

## Quickstart: Connecting Google Docs

1. **Start the Connection**  
   Look for a button such as **Connect Google Docs** in your account settings or integrations page inside this app. Click it.

2. **Sign in with Google**  
   A Google sign-in window will appear. Choose the Google account you want to connect.

3. **Review Permissions**  
   You will be asked to grant permission for this app to access your Google Docs. The next section lists exactly what we request and why.

4. **Allow Access**  
   Click **Allow** to finish connecting. You’ll be redirected back into this app. That’s it!

## What Permissions Are Requested?

To enable seamless features, this app requests the following permissions from your Google account:

| Permission | Why It’s Needed |
|------------|----------------|
| View and manage your Google Docs documents | Lets the app read, create, edit, and delete your Google Docs so you can fully sync content. |
| View your Google Docs documents | Lets the app view your documents and their details, but not make changes. Useful if you only want to read or import data. |
| View and manage Google Drive files created or opened by this app | Restricts access so the app can only work with documents it made or you open through it, not all your Drive files. |
| View the files in your Google Drive | Lets the app see your documents and files in Drive, but not change them. Enables browsing and preview features. |
| View and manage the files in your Google Drive | Lets the app read, edit, create, and delete files in your Drive—including Docs—for full syncing capability. |
| Access the currently open Google Docs document | Allows temporary access only to a document you’re currently working on, for operations like add-ons or short actions. |

**Note:** You will only be asked for the minimum permissions required by the features you use. You can review and revoke these at any time in your Google Account’s security settings.

## Test That Google Docs Is Connected

After connecting, you can:

- Import or sync a document from Google Docs.
- Export or save a document to Google Docs.
- View your documents in the integration area of this app.

If these actions work as expected, your account is properly connected!

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

- **Didn’t see the sign-in popup?**  
  Make sure popups are allowed in your browser for this website.
- **Chose the wrong Google account?**  
  Disconnect and try again—ensure you select the correct account during sign-in.
- **Permission denied or error message?**  
  Double-check which permissions you granted, and that you allowed this app to access the required documents.
- **Documents missing?**  
  If you only allowed access to specific files, the integration can only manage those. Broader access may be needed for full functionality.

# Connect Google Docs to Company A

Easily sync and manage your Google Docs with Company A. Connecting your account only takes a few steps and allows you to view, create, and edit your docs directly within Company A.

<Steps>
  <li>
    <b>Start the connection:</b> Click the <b>Connect Google Docs</b> button in your Company A account.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Sign in to your Google account:</b> If prompted, log in with your Google account credentials.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Review requested permissions:</b> Company A will ask for access to certain features in your Google Docs and (optionally) your Google Drive. See the list of possible permissions below—these let Company A sync and manage your documents on your behalf.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Approve access:</b> Click <b>Allow</b> to complete the connection. You will be directed back to Company A.
  </li>
</Steps>

<Info>
We use Google's secure sign-in (OAuth 2.0) to connect your account, so Company A never sees or stores your Google password.

## Permissions Requested

When you connect Google Docs, Company A may request one or more of the following permissions, depending on which features you use:

| Permission                                   | What it Allows                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| View & edit your Google Docs (`documents`)    | Full access to view, create, edit, and delete your Google Docs.          |
| View only your Google Docs (`documents.readonly`) | Read-only access: lets you see document content and details.         |
| Access Docs you own/open with Company A only (`drive.file`) | Limited to files you create or use with Company A.            |
| View your Google Drive files (`drive.readonly`) | Lets Company A view your existing Drive files, but not edit them.       |
| Full Google Drive access (`drive`)            | View and manage all Drive files, including Docs (broadest access).       |
| Current Doc only (`documents.currentonly`)    | Lets Company A work only with the Doc you're currently editing.          |

You will always see a confirmation screen letting you approve (or deny) the requested permissions before Company A can access your documents.

## Confirm the Connection

After approving access, you'll be directed back to Company A. You should now see your Google Docs account marked as <b>Connected</b>.

To test the integration:
- Try importing or syncing a document from Google Docs within Company A.
- If documents appear or sync as expected, you're all set!

## Troubleshooting & Common Questions

**Access denied or consent screen blocked?**
- Make sure you're using the correct Google account and have not denied required permissions.
- Try disconnecting any previous Google Docs integration from your Company A settings, then reconnect.

**Don’t see your Docs?**
- Only documents you have access to (per the permissions granted) will appear.
- If you didn't grant full access, you may need to adjust permissions and reconnect.

**How do I disconnect or change my Google account?**
- In Company A, go to your integrations or account settings, and click <b>Disconnect</b> next to Google Docs.
- You can reconnect with another Google account at any time.

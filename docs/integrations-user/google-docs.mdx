# Connect Google Docs to Your Account

Easily link your Google Docs account to Company A so you can sync, access, and manage documents directly from within Company A. The setup process is quick and secure.

## What Permissions Are Requested?

When connecting Google Docs, you will be prompted to approve certain permissions. Company A requests only the access needed to offer core features for document syncing and collaboration. Here’s what you may see and why we ask:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Permission</th>
      <th>What it means</th>
      <th>Why it's needed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>See and edit the documents you open with this app</td>
      <td>Allows temporary access to your currently open document, only while using the integration.</td>
      <td>Lets you sync or share the specific Google Doc you are working on within Company A.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Docs documents</td>
      <td>Full access to view, create, change, or delete your Google Docs.</td>
      <td>Used if you choose to sync or manage all Docs from Company A. Company A will only request this broader access if required for your workflow.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>See all your Google Docs documents</td>
      <td>Read-only access to your Docs—can view but not make changes.</td>
      <td>Lets you view your documents in Company A without making edits.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>See and edit the specific Google Drive files you use with this app</td>
      <td>Access is limited to files you select or create with Company A.</td>
      <td>Provides finer control and minimizes access to only the files you work with.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>See and download all your Google Drive files</td>
      <td>Read-only access to your entire Google Drive (including Docs).</td>
      <td>Used if you want to import documents from your Drive without granting edit permissions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Drive files</td>
      <td>Full access to your Google Drive files (including Docs).</td>
      <td>Only requested if you need broad document management within Company A.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

<Callout type="info">
Company A always requests the lowest permission level it needs for your workflow. You will never be asked for more access than is needed for the features you use.

## Testing the Connection

After connecting Google Docs, you can test the integration by:

- Importing a Google Doc into Company A
- Creating or exporting a Doc from Company A to Google Docs
- Viewing Google Docs from within Company A’s document section

If the integration was successful, you should see your Google Docs or be able to sync documents directly.

# Connect Google Docs

Easily link your Google Docs account to Company A so you can sync documents, collaborate, and automate workflows directly from one place.

---

## 1. Connect Your Google Docs Account

1. Click the **Connect** or **Sign in with Google** button on the integration page in your Company A settings.
2. If prompted, select the Google account you want to connect.
3. Review the list of permissions (see below) and click **Allow** to give permission.

---

## 2. Review the Permissions Requested

To connect, you’ll be asked to approve access to your Google Docs and Google Drive. These permissions ensure Company A can sync your files and automate document workflows. Here’s what the integration may request:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| **See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Allows Company A to read, update, create, or remove any Docs as needed for document syncing and management. |
| **See all your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | Allows Company A to display your Docs, but not change them. |
| **See, edit, create, and delete only the specific Google Drive files you use with this app** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Restricts access so Company A can only see or manage files you select or create through the app. |
| **See and download all your Google Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Lets Company A display or sync Docs/Drive files without making changes. |
| **See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Allows full access for maximum automation with Docs/Drive files. |

**Note:** You’ll always see a detailed list of permissions before approval. Some permissions may cause Google to show a warning or extra consent screen for your security.

## 3. Confirm Successful Connection

## 5. Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Having trouble connecting your Google Docs account?**

- **Make sure you’re signed into the correct Google account.** If you use multiple Google accounts, be sure the right one is selected during the connection process.
- **Enable pop-ups and third-party cookies.** The Google login prompt opens in a new window. If it doesn’t appear, check your browser settings.
- **Approve all requested permissions.** Denying any permission will prevent the integration from working.
- **App not verified?** If Google warns, “This app isn’t verified,” it means the app is still going through Google’s review for these permissions.
- **Revoke and retry connection.** Go to [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions), remove access for Company A, and try connecting again.
- **Persistent errors?** Contact Company A’s support team and include a screenshot and details about the error.

## What permissions are required and why?

When you connect your Google Docs account, Company A asks for the minimum required permissions to provide a smooth Docs experience. Depending on the features enabled, some or all of these permissions may be requested:

<Callout type="info">
<b>Requested permissions may include:</b>

- <b>See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Docs documents</b>  
  <small>(Scope: <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents</code>)</small>  
  Lets you fully manage your Docs—viewing, creating, updating, and removing documents as needed for advanced integrations.

- <b>See all your Google Docs documents</b>  
  <small>(Scope: <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly</code>)</small>  
  Lets Company A view your Docs content and metadata but not make any changes—it’s used for integrations where read-only workflows suffice.

- <b>See, edit, create, and delete only specific Google Drive files you use with this app</b>  
  <small>(Scope: <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file</code>)</small>  
  Company A only accesses Docs or Drive files you open through Company A, limiting its control and visibility to those files.

- <b>See and download all your Google Drive files</b>  
  <small>(Scope: <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</code>)</small>  
  Allows Company A to read any file in your Drive, not just Docs, but never edit or delete them.

- <b>See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Drive files</b>  
  <small>(Scope: <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</code>)</small>  
  This provides the broadest access and is only requested for all-encompassing document workflows.

- <b>See and edit the currently open document</b>  
  <small>(Scope: <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly</code>)</small>  
  The narrowest scope: lets Company A work only with the current Doc you have open.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
<b>Note:</b> You will only be asked for the permissions required for the features you use in Company A. We recommend granting only the access you are comfortable with.
</Callout>

## How do I know the integration worked?

- Check the Integrations page in your Company A settings for a “Connected” status next to Google Docs.
- Try importing or opening a Google Doc within Company A. You should see your documents listed—or be able to create a new Doc on the spot.
- Edits made in Company A should show up in Google Docs, and vice versa (depending on enabled features).

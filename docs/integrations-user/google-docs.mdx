# Connect your Google Docs account

Connecting your Google Docs account allows you to create, view, and manage documents directly from this app. The connection uses a secure Google sign-in to safely grant access to your documents.

## How to Connect

Follow these quick steps to connect your Google Docs account:

1. **Go to Integrations in [Your App]:** Open the app and navigate to the integrations or connections section.
2. **Find and Select Google Docs:** Click the option to connect Google Docs.
3. **Start Google Sign-in:** A window will appear prompting you to sign in with your Google account.
4. **Review Permissions:** Google will display a list of permissions requested by the app. Review these carefully.
5. **Grant Access:** Click "Allow" to grant access. You will be redirected back to the app.
6. **Connection Complete:** You'll see a confirmation message, and Google Docs is now connected.

## What Permissions Are Required?

When you connect, you will be asked to grant access to your Google account. Depending on how your app is set up, it may request some or all of the following permissions:

| Permission | What it allows |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| View and manage Google Docs documents | Lets the app read, create, edit, and delete your Google Docs documents. |
| View Google Docs documents only      | Lets the app view the content and details of your Google Docs without making changes. |
| Access files the app created or has been granted access to in Google Drive | Restricts file access only to those made or shared with the app.          |
| View all Google Drive files          | Lets the app view any file in your Google Drive, including Google Docs.  |
| View and manage all Google Drive files | Lets the app create, read, update, and delete any file in your Google Drive, including Docs. |
| Access current document only (temporary) | Allows temporary access just to the active Google Docs document, typically for add-ons. |

> **Note**: The app will only request the minimum permissions needed for its features. You can review permissions at any time in your Google Account settings.

## How to Confirm Your Connection Works

- Try importing or exporting a document between your app and Google Docs.
- After connecting, open the integrations page to check that Google Docs status is "Connected".
- If there is a "Test Connection" option, use it to verify access.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

**Issue: You connected the wrong Google account.**
> Sign out of your Google account in your browser, then repeat the steps above and select the correct account when prompted.

**Issue: Permissions denied or incomplete.**
> Make sure to grant all permissions requested by the app. If you skipped any, disconnect and reconnect, ensuring all boxes are checked.

**Issue: Documents not visible or not syncing.**
> Confirm that the correct account is linked and you have granted the app permission for the relevant scope (see above). Also ensure you have internet connectivity.

If you continue to have problems, check your app’s help page or contact support for further assistance.

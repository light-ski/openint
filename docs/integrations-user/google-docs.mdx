## Google Docs permissions explained

When you connect your Google Docs account, Company A requests the following permissions. These allow us to sync and manage your documents as described.

| Permission | Why it’s needed |
|---|---|
| **See and manage your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Required to create, edit, and sync documents with your account. |
| **View your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | Allows Company A to read your documents for importing or viewing. |
| **Access files created or used by Company A** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Lets Company A manage only the files it creates or you choose to use with Company A—no access to all your Drive content. |
| **See your Google Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Enables viewing of Docs or files you select for use in Company A, without editing. |
| **Manage all files in your Google Drive** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Required for full document management—including creating, editing, or deleting—if you enable additional features. |
| **Access the currently open Google Docs document** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Used only when working with a single open doc in real time (most limited; for specific live features only). |

<Info>
Company A will only request the minimum permissions required for your selected features. You can view the exact list on the Google authorization screen before approving.

## What permissions are requested?

When connecting, Company A requests the following permissions from your Google account:

| Permission | What this means |
|---|---|
| **See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Docs documents** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Allows Company A to view and manage all Google Docs in your account. |
| **See all your Google Docs documents** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | Allows read-only access to your Docs, with no ability to make changes. |
| **See, edit, create, and delete only the specific Google Drive files you use with this app** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Restricts access to only those files you open with Company A, not all your Drive content. |
| **See and download all your Google Drive files** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Grants viewing/downloading access for all files, but with no edits. |
| **See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Drive files** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Full management rights for all files and folders in your Google Drive. |
| **Access only the currently open Google Docs document** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Temporary access to a single document you’re working on (when used with certain features/add-ons). |

<Note>
Company A requests only the minimum permissions needed to provide its document integration features. More information about these permissions can be found in the [Google Docs API documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth).
</Note>

## Test your connection

After connecting, return to your Company A account. Try one of these actions to confirm Google Docs is connected:

- Open the Integrations or Connections page—your Google Docs account should show as "Connected".
- Try syncing or importing a document from Google Docs.
- If your connection fails, you may need to sign in again or review your permissions.

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
<b>"Access Denied" or "Authentication Failed" errors:</b><br>
- Ensure you completed all steps in the Google sign-in pop-up.<br>
- Check that you granted all requested permissions.<br>
- Refresh the page and try connecting again.<br>
- If you have multiple Google accounts, make sure the right one is selected.
</Warning>

<Note>To disconnect Google Docs from Company A, return to your Integrations page, find Google Docs, and choose **Disconnect**. You can always reconnect later if needed.</Note>

## Privacy & security

Your Google Docs account credentials are never shared with Company A. All authentication is managed directly by Google, and you can review or revoke access anytime via your [Google Account permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

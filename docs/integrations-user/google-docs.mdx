3. **Authorize Company A**
   - You’ll be redirected to Google’s secure login page.
   - Sign in with your Google account (or select an account if already logged in).
   - Google will display a screen asking you to grant permissions—see below for details on what these mean.
   - Click **Allow** to complete the connection.

## Permissions Explained

When connecting, you may see a request for one or more of the following Google permissions. These let Company A work with your documents:

| Permission | What it allows |
|---|---|
| **View and manage your Google Docs documents** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Lets Company A read, create, edit, and delete your Google Docs documents. |
| **View your Google Docs documents** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | Lets Company A read your document content and metadata, but never change it. |
| **View and manage Google Drive files that you have opened or created with this app** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Limited access to Google Docs/Drive files created or selected via Company A—does **not** give access to all your documents. |
| **See and download all your Google Drive files** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Lets Company A view all your files (including Docs) but not change or delete them. |
| **View and manage all your Google Drive files** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Lets Company A view, create, edit, and delete any file in your Google Drive, including Docs. |
| **Access currently open document** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Most restrictive: lets Company A access just the Google Doc currently open (used in special cases/add-ons). |

You may only see some of these depending on how Company A uses your documents.

<Alert type="warning">
You are always in control. If you’re uncomfortable with any permission, you can deny access or disconnect at any time.

## Testing the Integration

To check that your connection is working:

- Try importing, exporting, or syncing a document between Google Docs and Company A.
- Look for a test or confirmation message in the integration settings page.
- If Company A allows—you may see a list of your Google Docs, or get a success notification.

If you see an error, see troubleshooting below.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

- **Accidentally denied access**: Reconnect by clicking the Connect button again and accepting the permissions.
- **Wrong Google account**: Disconnect (or log out from Google), then reconnect and select the desired account.
- **Authorization expired**: If you receive a prompt to reauthorize, follow the steps above again.
- **Integration not working as expected**: Disconnect the integration and reconnect. If the problem persists, contact Company A’s support.

# Connect your Google Docs account

Easily link your Google Docs account to Company A to enable document syncing and integration features. You'll be guided through a secure Google sign-in process, after which Company A will be able to access the Google Docs files you choose to share.

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Start the connection">
In your Company A workspace, navigate to the Integrations section and find **Google Docs**. Click **Connect** or **Sign in with Google**.
</Step>
<Step title="2. Authorize access on Google">
You'll be redirected to Google's secure login screen. Sign in with your Google account (or select an account if you are already logged in).
</Step>
<Step title="3. Review permissions requested">
Google will display a list of permissions requested by Company A. Review these carefully (see below for an explanation of each). Click **Allow** to continue.
</Step>
<Step title="4. Complete Setup">
You'll be redirected back to Company A. If the connection is successful, you should see Google Docs listed as **Connected** in your Integrations list.
</Step>
</Steps>

## What permissions are requested?
To enable smooth integration, Company A will ask your permission to:

- **View and manage your Google Docs documents:** See, create, edit, or delete your Docs as needed for integration features.
- **View your Google Docs documents (Read only):** For cases where Company A only needs to view your documents.
- **Access only files you choose or that the integration creates:** So Company A only sees documents relevant to your workflow.
- **Read and manage all your Google Drive files:** (if enabled)—sometimes needed for advanced workflows that involve file handling beyond Docs.
- **Read only all your Google Drive files:** For workflows that just need to view documents/files.

You may be asked to grant one or more of the following permissions:

| Permission | Why it's needed |
|---|---|
| **See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Docs documents** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Allows Company A to fully manage documents for tasks like creation, updating, or deletion. |
| **See all your Google Docs documents (Read only)** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | Allows Company A to view documents' content and metadata as needed for syncing or viewing purposes. |
| **Access files this app creates or that you choose** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Restricts access to only those Google Drive files/documents you've selected or that Company A creates—ensuring privacy. |
| **See and download all your Google Drive files (Read only)** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Allows Company A to read your Drive files, no editing rights. Useful for workflows that require viewing linked content. |
| **See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Drive files** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Allows full access for comprehensive integration features, including file management and document workflows. |
| **Access only the currently open Google Docs document** <br> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Grants temporary access only to the document you are actively viewing, used in specific add-on workflows. |

For more details, see [Google's official docs for permissions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth#docs-scopes).

<Callout type="info">
**Privacy tip:** Company A will only access the files and data required to power the integration features you've enabled. You can revoke access at any time in your Google Account security settings.

## How to check if your Google Docs integration is working

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues connecting Google Docs:

- **Access denied or canceled?** Make sure you signed in with the correct Google account and consented to all requested permissions.
- **Already connected to a different account?** Disconnect and retry with the proper Google login.
- **Integration not responding?** Try refreshing the page or reconnecting.
- **Permissions changed or revoked?** If you removed access in your Google settings, simply reconnect following the steps above.

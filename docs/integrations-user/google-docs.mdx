## What permissions are requested?

When connecting Google Docs, Company A will request permissions from your Google account. These let Company A perform actions like syncing, searching, or saving documents on your behalf. Only the **minimum permissions needed** to make your selected features work will be requested.

### Typical permission requested

- **Access the currently open Google Docs document only**  
  (_most limited_)  
**Scope:** `documents.currentonly`
  - Allows access to just the open Google Doc for temporary operations.

### Other permissions that may be requested
Depending on your organization’s settings or the features you use, Company A might also request:

- **Read/write all Google Docs**  
`documents`  
_Allows viewing, creating, editing, and deleting Google Docs documents._

- **Read-only access to Docs**  
`documents.readonly`  
_Only allows viewing docs and their info._

- **Access to files created/shared with the app**  
`drive.file`  
_See Google Docs and files created by or specifically shared to Company A._

- **Read-only all Google Drive files**  
`drive.readonly`  
_View the contents (but not edit) of everything in Google Drive—including Google Docs._

- **Full access to your Drive files and docs**  
`drive`  
_Allows full editing and management of everything in Google Drive, including Google Docs._

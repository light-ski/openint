## What permissions are requested and why?

When you connect Google Docs, Company A will request permission to access your documents and files. Depending on the features you use, you may see a request for one or more of the following:

- **See, edit, create, and delete your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`):
  Allows Company A to interact fully with your Docs—view content, create new files, and edit them on your behalf.
- **See your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`):
  Grants read-only access—view content without making changes.
- **Access specific Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`):
  Lets Company A see and modify only the Docs and Drive files you’ve provided or created via the integration (not your entire Drive).
- **Read all Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`):
  Grants view-only access to all your Google Drive files, including Docs.
- **Full Drive access** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`):
  Allows Company A to fully manage all your Google Drive files, not just Docs. Only requested if your workflow requires it.
- **Access current document only** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`):
  Used for integrations that interact with just the document you have open—least access required.

<Callout type="warning">
Whenever possible, Company A requests only the most limited permissions needed for your tasks.
</Callout>

## How do I know it worked?

Once connected, you should see Google Docs as linked in your integrations list on Company A. Try creating a document or viewing Docs features in Company A—if they appear or synchronize as expected, you’re all set!

## Troubleshooting

**Didn’t see a Google login window?**

- Make sure your browser allows pop-ups.
- Check for an existing pop-up blocker or privacy extension.

**Accidentally denied access?**
Just try connecting again—you’ll have another chance to grant permission.

**Wrong account showing up?**
Sign out of any Google accounts you don’t want to use before starting, or use a private/incognito browser window.

**Still having problems?**
Contact Company A support for further assistance.

# Connect Your Google Docs Account

You can connect your Google Docs account to Company A to easily sync, view, or automate your documents within the app. With a secure integration, you’ll be able to work seamlessly with your Google Docs content—without ever leaving Company A.

**All you need is your Google login.** The connection is secure and you can review the exact permissions requested before you approve access.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Start Connecting Google Docs

1. Go to the **Integrations** or **Settings** page inside Company A’s app.
2. Find **Google Docs** in the list of available integrations.
3. Click **Connect** (or **Add Account**).
4. A window will appear, redirecting you to Google’s website to sign in and grant access.

## Step 2: Sign In and Grant Access

1. If prompted, enter your Google email and password.
2. Carefully review the list of permissions requested by Company A.
3. Click **Allow** to grant access. This is necessary for Company A to access and work with your Google Docs.

## Step 3: Permissions Requested (and Why)

When you connect, Company A may ask for the following Google Docs and Drive access. Here’s what each allows:

| Permission | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **View and manage your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Allows Company A to read, create, edit, and delete your Google Docs to enable full syncing and automation features. |
| **View your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | Lets Company A only view (not change) your documents if no editing features are needed. |
| **View and manage Drive files created or opened with this app** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Only gives access to documents Company A has created on your behalf or that you select; it does NOT allow access to all your Drive files. |
| **View all files on your Google Drive** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Lets Company A read your stored files (including Docs), but NOT change them. Useful if you want Company A to pull info from your files without editing. |
| **Full access to your Google Drive** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | This is the broadest permission; Company A can view, create, edit, and delete any Drive file if you approve this. Only required for advanced features. |
| **Access your current Google Docs document only** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Temporary access to just the document you’re working on, for limited or add-on operations. |

<Callout type="warning">
You are always in control. Only approve the permissions you are comfortable with. If you deny access, some Company A features may be unavailable.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Complete the Setup and Test Your Connection

After approving permissions, you will be sent back to Company A. The connection is now live!

- To test your connection:
  - Try opening or syncing a Google Doc from within Company A.
  - Create a new document in Company A and check it appears in your Google Docs.
  - If you see your recent docs or can save content, your connection works!

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

**Didn’t see the right Google account?**  
When signing in, click **Use another account** to log in as the correct user.

**Denied permissions by mistake?**  
Simply disconnect and reconnect, making sure to approve all requested permissions for full functionality.

**See a "User rate limit exceeded" or quota error?**  
Company A shares some usage limits set by Google. If you run into this, try again after a short wait, or contact support.

**Still having trouble?**  
Try the following:

- Make sure pop-ups aren’t blocked by your browser.
- Log out of your Google account, then try connecting again.
- Try a different browser or clear your cache.

## Disconnecting or Reconnecting

You are always in control of your integration. You can disconnect your Google Docs account from Company A at any time from the Integrations/Settings page. You may also reconnect following the same steps above.

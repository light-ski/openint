## What Permissions Are Requested?

When you connect your Google Docs account, you’ll be asked to grant certain permissions to Company A. Here’s a summary of what’s requested and why:

| Permission | What Company A can do |
| --- | --- |
| **See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Docs documents**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Full access for viewing, editing, creating, and deleting all Google Docs documents. Used for workflows that need management of your Docs across the platform. |
| **See all your Google Docs documents**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | Allows viewing the content and metadata of your Docs, without any editing or changes. Useful for integrations that only need to display documents. |
| **See, edit, create, and delete only the specific Drive files you use with Company A**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Access is limited only to the files you create with Company A or explicitly share with the app. No access to other Drive files. |
| **See and download all your Google Drive files**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Allows viewing and downloading all files in your Drive, including your Docs. No editing or deleting allowed. |
| **See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Drive files**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Full access to all Drive files for advanced document workflows, including bulk imports or exports. |
| **Access only the currently open Google Docs document**<br/>(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Allows actions only on the Docs document you have open right now (temporary, limited access). |

You may be prompted to accept one or more of these permissions depending on the features you use in Company A. Granting access allows Company A to sync, read, or update documents as required for your workflow. For further details, see Google’s [official permission guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/docs/api/auth).

<Callout type="warning">
Some permissions are labeled "sensitive" or "restricted" by Google. Company A only requests what’s necessary for its features. You can review all requested permissions before approving. Your data is never accessed beyond what you've allowed. For details, see Google's [API data policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy).

## How to Verify and Use Your Connection

- After connecting, your Google Docs should become available in your Company A workspace.
- Create, view, or sync documents to ensure the connection is working.
- If you encounter issues, try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Callout type="caution">
If you see an "Access Denied" error, or you denied permissions during the Google sign-in process, you can retry the connection by clicking **Connect Google Docs** again and accepting all requested permissions.

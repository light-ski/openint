# Connect your Google Docs account to Company A

Connect your Google Docs account to Company A to enable features like document synchronization, automated workflows, and more. The connection process is secure and uses your Google account’s built-in sign-in for fast setup.

<Steps>
**1. Start the connection**
Click the <strong>Connect Google Docs</strong> button in your Company A dashboard. This will launch a secure Google sign-in window.

**2. Sign in to Google**
Select the Google account you want to connect. If prompted, log in with your credentials.

**3. Review and grant permissions**
You’ll be asked to grant Company A specific permissions to your Google Docs and Drive account. Review the permissions, then click <strong>Allow</strong> to continue.

**4. Complete and confirm**
Once you grant access, you’ll be redirected back to Company A. You should see a confirmation message that your Google Docs integration is connected.
</Steps>

## What permissions are requested?

When connecting, Company A requests the minimum permissions needed to enable features such as viewing, creating, or editing your documents. The following permissions (also known as “scopes”) may be requested:

<Callout type="info" title="About Permissions">

- **View and manage your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`):
  Allows Company A to view, create, modify, and delete your Google Docs as needed to power integrations.
- **View your Google Docs documents only** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`):
  Lets Company A read your Docs and document details, but not edit them.
- **Access specific Google Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`):
  Lets Company A read and write only the files you select or create through Company A—no other files are accessed.
- **Read-only access to all Google Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`):
  Lets Company A view all files in your Drive, for features that need to read document content, but not make changes.
- **Full access to all Google Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`):
  Grants Company A the broadest access, used only if necessary to support all integration features.
- **Access your current document only (temporary)** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`):
  Provides the most limited, temporary access to just the currently open document (used only in some features).

Most users will only be asked for minimal, temporary permissions unless broader access is essential for requested features.

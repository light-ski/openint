# Connect Your Google Docs Account

Easily link your Google Docs account to your Company A profile to enable seamless syncing and management of your documents. With this integration, you’ll be able to view, edit, and manage your Google Docs content directly from Company A (with your permission).

## How to Connect Google Docs

1. **Go to the Integrations page** in your Company A account settings.
2. Find **Google Docs** in the list of available integrations.
3. Click **Connect**.
4. A new window will open prompting you to sign in to your Google account. Select the Google account you’d like to connect.
5. Review the permissions requested and click **Allow** to grant access.
6. After authorization, you’ll return to Company A and see a confirmation message that your Google Docs account is connected.

Google will prompt you to review and grant permissions to Company A for accessing your Google Docs and Drive files. These permissions are required for Company A to sync and display your Google Docs content.

## What Permissions Are Required?

When you connect your Google Docs account, Company A will ask for specific permissions. Here’s what’s requested and why:

- **View and manage your Google Docs documents**  (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`)
  - Lets Company A display your document list, read document content, and allow you to edit or create Docs within the platform.
- **View your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`)
  - Allows Company A to display your document list and let you read but not edit documents.
- **Access files created by Company A or specifically shared with it** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`)
  - Restricts Company A’s access to only files necessary for integrations or new Docs you create from Company A.
- **View Google Drive files**  (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`)
  - Lets Company A read (but not change) both Docs and Drive files that you have access to.
- **View and manage Google Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`)
  - Enables full read/write access for Docs you want integrated deeply between platforms, including uploading or syncing Docs.
- **Access the currently open Google Doc only (for limited use cases)** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`)
  - The most limited permission: only allows access to a specific document when authorized for it.

**Privacy Tip:**
You’re always in control. Company A will only access the documents you authorize and use the permissions strictly for syncing, viewing, and managing your Google Docs as described above.

## How to Verify the Connection

After connecting:

- Go to your Company A dashboard and check if your Google Docs are visible or synced.
- Try editing, creating, or syncing a document from Company A and confirm the changes appear in your Google Docs account.
- If you encounter an error, see the troubleshooting tips below.

## Troubleshooting

- **Didn’t see the Google prompt?**
  - Ensure your browser allows pop-ups from Company A.
- **Consent screen denied or closed?**
  - Try connecting again and make sure to grant all the requested permissions.
- **Wrong Google account?**
  - Disconnect and reconnect with the correct account.
- **Permissions error?**
  - Double-check that you granted all permissions during the Google sign-in. You can always remove access in your Google Account settings and reconnect.
- **General error or connection failed?**
  - Refresh the page and try again, or contact Company A support for further help.

## Disconnecting the Integration
You can disconnect your Google Docs account at any time from the Integrations page in your Company A settings. Revoking access will immediately stop data syncing between Company A and Google Docs.

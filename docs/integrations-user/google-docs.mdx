## Permissions & What They Mean

When connecting Google Docs, you’ll be asked to grant the following permissions:

| Permission | Description | Why We Need It |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **documents (Full access)**<br/>`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` | Read, create, edit, and delete your Google Docs documents. | Enables full document management, including creating new docs or updating existing ones from [Company A]. |
| **documents.readonly**<br/>`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly` | View the content and metadata of your Google Docs documents. | Lets you view and import documents, but not change them. |
| **drive.file**<br/>`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` | Read and write access to specific Google Drive files created or explicitly chosen with [Company A]. | Keeps permissions minimal by limiting access to only those files you select or create with [Company A]. |
| **drive.readonly**<br/>`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` | Read-only access to all of your Google Drive files, including Docs. | Import content from any document in your Drive without modifying them. |
| **drive (Full access)**<br/>`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` | Full read/write access to all files in your Google Drive, including Docs. | Required for broad document automation features—such as managing docs in nested folders. |
| **documents.currentonly**<br/>`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly` | Access to only the currently open Google Docs document (for specific add-on use cases). | Used for temporary, limited access when working with the open document in real time. |

> **Note:** [Company A] will only use the permissions necessary to perform the integration features you choose. You always stay in control of your data and can disconnect at any time.

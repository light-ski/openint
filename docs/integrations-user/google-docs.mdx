## Permissions & Why They Are Needed

When you connect Google Docs, Company A requests certain permissions to enable document features. You will see a summary of these during the Google sign-in process. Here’s what we may request and why:

- **View and manage your Google Docs documents**
  - Allows reading, creating, editing, and deleting Google Docs as needed for features such as syncing, importing, and exporting documents.
- **Read-only access to your Google Docs**
  - Lets Company A display your files and document details, without making changes.
- **Access only files created or selected with Company A**
  - Limits access to documents initiated or explicitly shared during usage.
- **Read-only access to Google Drive**
  - Supports importing or listing Docs stored in your Drive, while preventing any modifications.
- **Full access to Google Drive** (if requested)
  - Enables the broadest features, such as organizing or managing Docs files across all folders for full sync and automation.
- **Temporary access to the currently open document only**
  - Used for situations where only one document needs to be accessed during a session.

> We only request permissions needed for the requested features. You always have control over what you share with Company A.

## Testing Your Integration

After connecting, you can verify that your Google Docs account is successfully linked by:

- Importing or opening a document from within Company A
- Creating or exporting a document to your Google Docs account
- Checking the Integrations page for a "Connected" status next to Google Docs

Any problems linking your account will usually be displayed directly in the dashboard.

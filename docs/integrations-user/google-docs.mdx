## What Permissions Are Needed?

When you connect Google Docs, Company A may request some (or all) of the following permissions:

| Permission                          | Why This Is Needed                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **View and manage Google Docs**<br/><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents</code> | Lets you view, create, edit, and organize your documents directly from Company A.                                  |
| **View Google Docs only**<br/><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly</code> | Allows viewing (not editing) your Docs from Company A.                                                            |
| **Access files created with Company A**<br/><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file</code> | Only allows access to Docs that you create or explicitly link to Company A.                                         |
| **View all Google Drive files**<br/><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</code>  | Lets you view your Drive files (including Docs), but does not allow changes.                                       |
| **View and manage all Google Drive files**<br/><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</code> | Allows full access to manage any file in your Drive, if needed for advanced document syncing features.             |
| **Temporary access to open Doc**<br/><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly</code> | Provides short-term access to the current document (when needed for one-time actions, like add-ons).               |

<Notice type="info">To limit access, choose the minimum permissions needed for what you want to do. We recommend connecting only the Google account you want to use with Company A.</Notice>

## Testing the Integration

After connecting, you can test your Google Docs integration:

- Go to your documents or workspace in Company A.
- Try importing, creating, or syncing a Google Doc—you should see your available files.
- If everything appears and works as expected, your connection is active!

## Troubleshooting

**Having trouble connecting, or not seeing your documents?**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can’t sign in to Google">
    Make sure pop-ups are allowed in your browser and that you’re using the right Google account. If you have multiple accounts, try signing out and logging in again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Permissions were denied by mistake">
    If you accidentally denied permissions, disconnect Google Docs in Company A, then try connecting again to restart the process.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My documents aren’t showing up">
    Refresh your Company A workspace and check that your Google Docs account has the right files and folders shared. If you only allowed limited access, you may only see some files.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection expired or stopped working">
    Sometimes the connection needs to be refreshed for security. Disconnect Google Docs on Company A, then reconnect using the steps above.

## What Permissions Are Requested?

Depending on the features you want to use, Company A may request one or more of these permissions:

| Permission | Why we need it |
|------------|---------------|
| **View and manage your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Allows Company A to fully sync, edit, create, or delete Docs on your behalf. Required for advanced actions. |
| **View only your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | Lets Company A safely read your Docs (for dashboards or imports) without making changes. |
| **Work with just selected Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Company A can only access Docs you select or create via Company A; your other Drive files are not exposed. |
| **Read all your Google Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Enables Company A to read or import Docs from anywhere in your Drive, without ever changing your data. |
| **Full Drive access** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Needed for Company A’s most powerful document automation. Allows full management of your Drive files including Docs. |
| **Current document only** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Provides very temporary access to a single Google Doc (for certain add-on features). |

<Callout type="warning">
You will be shown a summary of requested permissions by Google before you approve. Company A always requests the minimum needed for your selected features.

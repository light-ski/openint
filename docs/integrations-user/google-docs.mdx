## What Permissions Are Requested (and Why)?

When connecting, Company A requests the following permissions from Google. These are needed so you can view, create, and manage your documents directly from Company A:

- <b>View and manage your Google Docs documents</b><br />
  Needed to let Company A read, create, edit, or delete documents on your behalf.
- <b>View your Google Docs documents</b><br />
  For read-only features, such as showing document content or metadata (but canâ€™t make changes).
- <b>Access files created or opened with this app in your Google Drive</b><br />
  Ensures Company A can work with documents specifically managed through its interface, not all your Drive files.
- <b>View files in your Google Drive</b><br />
  For features that let you select or link files, Company A may need to display your Drive contents (read-only, no edits).
- <b>View and manage the files in your Google Drive</b><br />
  Allows full document management, including sharing documents created with Company A.
- <b>Access only the currently open document (for some features)</b><br />
  Used for tight, temporary accessâ€”usually for in-app features that only need to interact with the document youâ€™re working on.

> Youâ€™ll always see exactly which permissions are requested on the Google sign-in screen before you approve access.

- Only one Google account can be connected at a timeâ€”check youâ€™re signed in with the right one.
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting if something doesnâ€™t seem right.
- If you revoked Company Aâ€™s access in your Google Account, youâ€™ll need to reconnect.

## What Permissions Are Required?

<Expandable title="View details about Google Docs permissions">

When you connect your Google Docs account, Company A requests permission to:

- <b>Access your Google Documents</b> - View and manage the content of your Docs to enable syncing, importing, or updating documents from your Company A workspace.
- <b>View your Google Drive files</b> (where applicable) - In some cases, access to Drive is required for document management features.

The specific permissions that may be requested are:

- <code>documents.currentonly</code>: Access only to the specific document you’re working with (most limited scope; typically used for one-time operations).
- <code>documents</code>: Full access to view and edit your Google Docs (if your Company A use case requires creating or updating documents from within the platform).
- <code>documents.readonly</code>: View-only access to your Google Docs.
- <code>drive.file</code>: Access to Drive files that Company A created or you specifically shared with Company A.
- <code>drive.readonly</code>: View-only access to your Google Drive files.
- <code>drive</code>: Full read/write access to your Google Drive (rarely required, only if advanced Drive operations are enabled).

> <b>Note:</b> Company A will only request the minimum set of permissions necessary for your chosen features. You’ll always have a chance to review these before approving.

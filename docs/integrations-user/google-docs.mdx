  <Step title="Sign in to Google">
    A new window will open. Log in with your Google account if prompted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review permissions">
    Google will show you a list of permissions this integration is asking for (see below). Review them, then click <b>Allow</b>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finish">
    The window will close automatically and you’ll be returned to Company A. That’s it—your accounts are now connected!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What permissions are required?

Depending on how your Company A workspace is set up, the Google Docs integration may request one or more of the following permissions:

<Table>
| Permission | What it allows |
|------------|----------------|
| **View and edit all Google Docs** <br/><code>documents</code> | The app can view, edit, create, and delete any of your Google Docs. |
| **Read all Google Docs** <br/><code>documents.readonly</code> | The app can view all your Google Docs but cannot change or delete them. |
| **Access files opened with this app** <br/><code>drive.file</code> | The app can view, create, and edit only the Google Drive files and folders you use with Company A. It cannot see or change other Drive files. |
| **View all Google Drive files** <br/><code>drive.readonly</code> | The app can view and download any file in your Google Drive, but cannot change or delete your files. |
| **Edit all Google Drive files** <br/><code>drive</code> | The app can view, edit, create, and delete any file or document in your Drive (Docs, Sheets, and others). |
| **Current Doc only** <br/><code>documents.currentonly</code> | The app can access only the Google Doc you're working on right now. This is the most limited and private permission. |

You may not be asked for all these permissions—what’s required depends on how your Company A workspace uses Google Docs. If you’re unsure, ask your workspace admin which permissions are selected.

# Connect Google Docs to Your Account

Connect your Google Docs account to Company A to enable document sharing, syncing, or workflow automation. This process is secure and uses Google's official sign-in (OAuth2) flow—you never share your password with us.

## How to Connect Google Docs

1. **Start the Connection**: In your Company A dashboard, go to **Integrations** → **Google Docs** and click **Connect**.
2. **Sign in to Google**: A secure pop-up will appear. Sign in with your Google account if prompted.
3. **Review Permissions**: You'll be asked to approve access to your Google Docs or Drive.
4. **Grant Access**: Click **Allow** to complete the connection.
5. **Finish**: You'll be redirected back to Company A. The integration is now active.

<Info>We use the official Google sign-in. Your credentials are never shared with Company A.</Info>

## What Permissions Are Requested?
Depending on Company A's features, you may be asked for one or more of the following permissions. Here is what they mean and why they are needed:

<Card title="Manage All Google Docs" icon="file-text">
**Full Docs Access**<br/>
View, create, edit, and delete all your Google Docs documents (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents</code>).
<br/><br/>
<strong>Why?</strong> Needed for advanced workflows, like bi-directional document sync.
</Card>

<Card title="Read Google Docs Only" icon="eye">
**Read-Only Docs Access**<br/>
View all your Google Docs documents without making any changes (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly</code>).
<br/><br/>
<strong>Why?</strong> Needed if Company A should only read or list your documents.
</Card>

<Card title="Manage Created Docs" icon="file-plus">
**Drive File Access**<br/>
View and manage only Docs files that Company A has created or you have explicitly shared with it (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file</code>).
<br/><br/>
<strong>Why?</strong> For the most secure experience—limits access to specific files.
</Card>

<Card title="Read-Only Google Drive" icon="folder-open">
**Drive Read-Only Access**<br/>
View all your Google Drive files, including Docs, but cannot make changes (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly</code>).
<br/><br/>
<strong>Why?</strong> To power read-only integrations or reporting.
</Card>

<Card title="Full Google Drive Access" icon="database">
**Full Drive Access**<br/>
View, create, edit, and delete any file in your Google Drive (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</code>).
<br/><br/>
<strong>Why?</strong> Needed if workflows require working with all Drive contents.
</Card>

<Card title="Current Document Only" icon="file-search">
**Current Docs Session Access**<br/>
Access only the currently open document (used in some add-on features) (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly</code>).
<br/><br/>
<strong>Why?</strong> Needed for very limited, single-document flows.
</Card>

<Note>Exact permissions requested depend on your workflow. You can review and revoke app access from your Google Account security settings at any time.</Note>

- Open the Integration settings page in Company A and confirm Google Docs is **Connected**.

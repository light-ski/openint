## What Permissions Are Requested—and Why?

<Callout type="info" title="Your Privacy Matters">
Company A only requests permissions needed to sync your Google Docs documents and help you work efficiently. You stay in control and can revoke access from your Google account at any time.
</Callout>

Here are the permissions and what they allow:

- **View and manage your Google Docs documents** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`):
  Allows Company A to create, edit, and delete your Google Docs—so you can manage documents directly in the Company A platform.
- **Read-only access to your Docs** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`):
  Lets Company A display your Docs for viewing and importing, but not editing or deleting.
- **Manage Drive files the app created or accessed** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`):
  Provides Company A access only to Google Drive files it has been granted—ensuring privacy over unrelated files.
- **Read-only access to all Google Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`):
  Lets Company A view your files for easier document searching or importing, but not change them.
- **Full access to all Drive files** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`):
  Allows Company A to help you sync or manage all Drive files, including Docs.
- **Temporary access to the currently open document only** (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`):
  Limits access to a specific document. Used in some special document workflows only.

*Note: Company A will only request the permissions required for your use case, and you’ll see everything in the Google consent screen before accepting.*

## How Do I Know It's Working?

After connecting, you’ll see your Google Docs content appear inside Company A. You can now import, edit, or create documents, depending on the features your Company A plan supports.

- Look for a "Connected" badge next to Google Docs in Integrations.
- Try importing a document to check things are working.

## Troubleshooting

If you’re having trouble connecting your Google Docs account:

- Double-check you’re logged in to the right Google account in your browser.
- Make sure you approved all requested permissions in the Google consent pop-up.
- If you accidentally denied permissions, disconnect and try again.
- Try refreshing the integrations page and reconnecting.
- Visit your [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) to check or revoke app access.
- Still having trouble? Contact Company A support for help.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I disconnect Google Docs later?**

> Yes! You can revoke access at any time from within Company A’s integrations page, or from your [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

**Will Company A see or edit all my files?**

> Company A only accesses files as per the permissions you grant. When possible, the integration will use the most limited access—never more than is needed for your workflow.

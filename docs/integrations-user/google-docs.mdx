## Permissions Explained

When you connect your Google Docs account, Company A requests access to specific parts of your Google Docs and Drive so it can sync, import, or manage your documents as needed. The permissions you’re asked to grant may include:

      <th>Why Company A Needs It</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>documents</code>: Full Google Docs access</td>
      <td>View, create, edit, and delete your Google Docs documents</td>
      <td>Needed if you wish to edit or sync documents directly via Company A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>documents.readonly</code>: Read-only access</td>
      <td>View document content and metadata, but cannot modify anything</td>
      <td>For viewing or importing documents, without editing</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>drive.file</code>: Specific Drive file access</td>
      <td>View and manage only those files Company A creates or is granted access to</td>
      <td>Minimizes access to just the docs you select for Company A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>drive.readonly</code>: Google Drive read-only</td>

      <td><code>drive</code>: Full Drive access</td>
      <td>Full read, write, and manage access to all Drive documents and files</td>
      <td>Needed for features that involve broader management of your documents via Company A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>documents.currentonly</code></td>

## Testing the Connection

Once connected, you can confirm everything is working by:

- Viewing your connected accounts under **Settings** → **Integrations** in Company A
- Trying to sync, import, or use a Google Docs-based feature in Company A
- Looking for a confirmation or "Connected" status next to Google Docs

If you see your documents or are able to interact with Google Docs as expected, your connection is live and active!

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

**Having trouble connecting? Try these tips:**

- **Did you grant all requested permissions?** If not, disconnect and try connecting again, making sure to accept all permission prompts.
- **Wrong Google account?** Disconnect, log out of Google, and reconnect using the correct account.
- **Pop-up blocked?** Ensure your browser allows pop-ups for Company A, as the Google sign-in uses a pop-up window.
- **Connection expired or revoked?** Your connection can expire if permissions change or are revoked on Google's end. Disconnect and re-connect to restore access.

# Connect Your Google Docs Account

Easily link your Google Docs with Company A to seamlessly sync files and improve productivity. This guide walks you through connecting your account, the permissions involved, and how to troubleshoot common issues.

## What Permissions Will Be Requested?

When you connect Google Docs, Company A asks you for permission to access certain files in your Google account via Google’s secure sign-in process. Here’s what each of the permissions ("scopes") means:

| Permission | What Does This Enable? |
|---|---|
| **View and edit your Google Docs**  <br/>[`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`] | View, create, modify, and delete any of your Google Docs documents. |
| **View your Google Docs**  <br/>[`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`] | See all your Google Docs content, but not make changes. |
| **View and edit only the active Doc**  <br/>[`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`] | Access and edit just the document you’re working on now. |
| **View, edit, or delete specific Google Drive files**  <br/>[`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`] | Limited to only the Google Drive files you interact with in Company A, or files that Company A creates for you. |
| **View all Google Drive files**  <br/>[`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`] | See (but not change) everything in your Google Drive, including Docs. |
| **View and edit all Google Drive files**  <br/>[`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`] | Full access: view, edit, create, or delete anything in your Google Drive. |

> **Tip:** You’re always shown a summary of the requested permissions by Google before you approve access.

## How to Test Your Connection

- Open Company A and try to create, sync, or access a Google Doc.
- If the integration worked, you’ll see your docs appear or be able to use Google Docs features inside Company A.
- Edits made in either Company A or Google Docs will sync once connected.

:::tip
If you can’t see your documents or features aren’t available, check that you granted all requested permissions and are using the correct Google account.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Pop-up blocked or sign-in screen not showing?**  
  Disable browser pop-up blockers temporarily, or try a different browser.

- **Accidentally denied permissions?**  
  Disconnect Google Docs in Company A and reconnect, making sure to approve all permissions.

- **Google shows a security warning?**  
  Ensure you’re signing in to the intended account and trust Company A to access your files.

- **Sync isn’t working or files seem missing?**  
  Double-check permissions, your logged-in Google account, and try disconnecting and reconnecting.

If issues persist, visit Company A support or contact their help team.

## Manage and Revoke Access Any Time

- You stay in control: to disconnect, simply remove the integration in Company A settings.
- You can also revoke Company A’s access through your Google Account’s [security permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

> Company A can only access documents and files if you approve access. You can remove this at any time for full privacy and control.

# Connect Outreach

You can connect your Outreach account to sync your contacts, sequences, and communication data with your [App Name] account. This lets you manage and sync your Outreach sales data directly within [App Name]—saving time and avoiding manual updates.

## How to Connect Outreach

Follow these steps to securely link your Outreach account:

1. **Start the connection**
    - In your [App Name] dashboard, find the option to link Outreach (often under Integrations, Connections, or a similar menu).
    - Click **Connect Outreach**.

2. **Sign in to Outreach**
    - A new window will appear prompting you to log in to your Outreach account.
    - Enter your Outreach credentials (email and password).

3. **Review permissions**
    - You’ll see a list of permissions that [App Name] is requesting from Outreach.
    - Review them, then click **Authorize** to continue.

4. **Finish and verify**
    - After authorizing, you’ll be redirected back to [App Name].
    - You should see a success message confirming that your Outreach account is connected.

## Permissions Explained

Connecting Outreach will request the following permissions:

- **Read your profile** – Allows access to your basic profile information (name, email, etc.).
- **Read prospects** – Allows reading your Outreach prospect data (contacts and engagement history) to sync or display in [App Name].
- **Edit prospects** – Allows creating new or updating prospects from within [App Name].
- **Read sequences** – Allows reading your Outreach email sequences so you can view or manage them.
- **Edit sequences** – Allows creating or modifying sequences and templates from [App Name].
- **Full admin access** – Needed for certain advanced actions that require administrative rights (for example, managing all integrations or settings).

**Note:** [App Name] will only use the permissions necessary to sync your Outreach data as requested. Your information is handled securely, and you can revoke access at any time from your Outreach account settings.

## Testing Your Connection

Once the connection is made, you can:

- View Outreach data in [App Name]
- Sync or import contacts and sequences
- Try creating or updating prospect records
- Check for success or error messages in the Integrations or Connections section

If everything syncs as expected, your integration is working!

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

Here are a few things to check if you run into issues:

- **Authorization failed or permissions denied:** Double-check that you’ve accepted all required permissions during the sign-in process.
- **Wrong Outreach account:** Make sure you’re logging in with the correct Outreach account, especially if you’re signed into multiple accounts in your browser.
- **Access was revoked:** If you previously removed [App Name]'s access in Outreach, you’ll need to reconnect.
- **Insufficient permissions:** If your Outreach role is limited, you might need admin rights for full functionality. Contact your Outreach admin if unsure.
- **No data appears after connecting:** Try disconnecting and reconnecting, and refresh your [App Name] dashboard.

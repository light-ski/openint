# Connecting Lever

Lever is a leading recruiting and applicant tracking system. By connecting your Lever account, you can link job application data directly to {{APP_NAME}}, making your hiring workflows smoother and more efficient.

## Quickstart: How to Connect Lever

1. In your {{APP_NAME}} dashboard, navigate to **Integrations** and select **Lever**.
2. Click **Connect Lever**.
3. You’ll be redirected to Lever’s website to log in (if you aren’t already).
4. Review the permissions requested and click **Allow** to authorize access.
5. You’ll be sent back to {{APP_NAME}}, and Lever will now be connected!

## What Permissions Are Requested?

When you connect Lever, you will be asked to grant the following permission:

| Permission                | Why This Is Needed                                                                                       |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read job applications     | Allows {{APP_NAME}} to safely access your application data in Lever (no editing rights are granted).    |

Only read-only access to job applications and related data is requested. No changes are made to your Lever account.

## Testing Your Connection

Once connected, you can:

- View or sync your Lever job applications in {{APP_NAME}}.
- Confirm that new data appears by navigating to your job applications page.

If you do not see your Lever data as expected, try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Access Denied / Consent Not Granted:** Make sure you clicked **Allow** on Lever’s permission screen.
- **Wrong Lever Account:** Check you are signed into the correct Lever account before authorizing.
- **Missing Data:** The connection only pulls job application data. If other data is missing, ensure it is included in Lever's job applications section.
- **General Connection Problems:** Try disconnecting and reconnecting. If problems persist, contact support.

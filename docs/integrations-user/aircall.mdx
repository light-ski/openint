# Connect Aircall to [App Name]

Easily link your Aircall account with your [App Name] workspace to sync calls, contacts, and other related data. This integration allows you to view and make the most of your Aircall information directly within [App Name].

## Before You Begin

- Ensure you have an active Aircall account.
- You must be able to sign in to Aircall and have the necessary permissions (see below).
- Access your [App Name] account where you want to connect Aircall.

## How to Connect Aircall

Follow these steps to securely connect your Aircall account:

1. In [App Name], go to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
2. Find **Aircall** in the list and select **Connect**.
3. You’ll be redirected to Aircall’s secure login page. Log in with your Aircall credentials if prompted.
4. Aircall will ask you to grant permissions. Review the permissions, then click **Authorize** to continue.
5. You will be redirected back to [App Name], and your connection will be established.

## Requested Permissions

When connecting Aircall, the following permissions may be requested. These allow [App Name] to integrate seamlessly with your Aircall data:

- **public_api**: Accesses public Aircall API functionality (typically for non-sensitive, read-only data).
- **contacts.read**: View your Aircall contacts, letting [App Name] sync contact data.

Depending on your [App Name] workspace, additional permissions might be requested:

- **users.read**: Read-only access to your Aircall user profiles.
- **calls.read**: Read call logs and details (for viewing recent calls in [App Name]).
- **numbers.read**: Read phone numbers in your Aircall account.
- **calls.write**: Start or modify calls from within [App Name].
- **users.write**: Invite or update users via [App Name].
- **admin**: Full Aircall admin access (requested only if required by your admin for setup—review carefully before accepting).

**Tip:** Only the permissions required for your [App Name] integration will be requested. You can safely deny any permissions that are not necessary for your use case.

## Testing the Connection

After connecting, verify the integration:

1. Go to your Aircall section or dashboard in [App Name].
2. Check that your contacts or calls appear as expected.
3. Try refreshing the page or logging a test call to confirm syncing is working.

If you don’t see your Aircall data immediately, it could take a few minutes to sync.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

If you’re having trouble connecting Aircall:

- **Permission denied**: Ensure you’ve approved all required permissions during the authorization step.
- **Wrong Aircall account**: Double-check you’re logged into the correct Aircall account when authorizing.
- **Abandoned flow**: If you close the Aircall login or authorization page, you’ll need to restart the connection process in [App Name].
- **Missing data after connecting**: It may take a few minutes for your contacts and calls to sync. Try refreshing your [App Name] dashboard.
- **Authorization error**: Make sure pop-ups are enabled and your Aircall account is active.

If you continue to have issues, contact [App Name] support for further assistance.

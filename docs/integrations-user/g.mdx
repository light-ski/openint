# What Permissions Are Requested?

By connecting, you allow Company A to access your Google Docs for the features you enable. The following permissions may be requested during setup:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **View and edit your Google Docs documents** <br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Lets Company A view, create, edit, and delete your Google Docs. Required for full sync and editing. |
| **View your Google Docs documents** <br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | Lets Company A view your Docs only (no editing or deleting). Useful for simple import/read features. |
| **See, edit, create, and delete only the Google Drive files you use with Company A** <br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Restricts access so Company A can **only** manage files you create with Company A or select via a file picker. Recommended for most use cases. |
| **View the files in your Google Drive** <br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Lets Company A view all your Drive files (including non-Docs files), but cannot edit or delete. |
| **Full access to all files in your Google Drive** <br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Lets Company A view, create, edit, and delete any file in your Google Drive, not just Docs. This is the broadest permission—requested **only if strictly necessary**. |
| **Access only the currently open Google Docs document** <br/> (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Short-term access to a single document in Google Docs (often used for specific, temporary operations inside Docs add-ons). |

<Callout type="info">
<strong>Why are these permissions needed?</strong><br/>
Only the permissions required for the features you use will be requested. The most limited permissions are chosen whenever possible. You can view or change what Company A can access during setup, and you stay in control at all times.

# How to Test the Connection

After completing setup, you can:
- Import a document from Google Docs to Company A, or
- Open a Docs file inside Company A’s Docs integration panel.

If the integration works, you’ll see your documents or be able to run the feature you expect (e.g., syncing, importing, or editing).

<Callout type="tip">
If you don’t see your documents, double-check that you signed in with the intended Google account, and that you accepted all required permissions.

# Troubleshooting and Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I can’t connect my Google account">

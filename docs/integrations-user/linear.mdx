# Connect Your Linear Account

Integrating your Linear account lets you seamlessly manage tickets and issues directly from Your App. Follow the steps below to securely connect Linear and start syncing data in moments.

## How to Connect Linear

1. **Find the Linear integration**
   - In Your App, go to **Integrations** (or **Settings > Integrations**).
   - Locate the **Linear** option and click **Connect**.
2. **Authorize access**
   - A secure Linear window will open. Log in if prompted.
   - Review the list of permissions requested.
   - Click **Authorize** to grant access.
3. **Connection complete!**
   - You’ll be redirected back to Your App. Linear is now connected.

## Permissions Requested

When connecting Linear, you may see the following permissions requested:

- **read**: (Always required) Allows Your App to access information in your Linear account.
- **write**: Enables Your App to update data in Linear, such as creating new issues or comments.
- **issues:create**: Allows Your App to create new issues and attachments in your Linear workspace.
- **comments:create**: Allows Your App to create new comments on Linear issues.
- **timeSchedule:write**: Allows creating and updating time schedules related to issues or projects.
- **admin**: Full administrative access. This is rarely requested and only if needed for advanced features.

Your App only ever requests the permissions that are necessary for your features. You can review or revoke these permissions through your Linear account at any time.

## How to Verify the Connection

- After connecting, try syncing issues or viewing Linear tickets inside Your App.
- Create a new issue or comment from Your App—confirm it appears in your Linear workspace.

If there’s an error message or data doesn’t sync, see Troubleshooting below.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue:** I saw an error or my Linear data isn’t syncing.

- Double-check that you completed the OAuth authorization and granted all requested permissions.
- Ensure you are logged into the correct Linear account when authorizing.
- If you declined required permissions, disconnect Linear from Your App and reconnect, granting all permissions.
- Try logging out and logging in again in both Linear and Your App.
- If problems persist, visit Linear’s [Authorized Applications](https://linear.app/settings/applications) page to revoke and re-authorize access.

**Privacy & Security Tip:** You can remove integration access anytime in your Linear settings. Only the permissions you accepted are granted to Your App.

# Connect your Facebook account

You can connect your Facebook account with {{APP_NAME}} to unlock new features—such as importing your posts, photos, or syncing events and friends. Connecting is quick and secure, and you remain in control of what you share.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection">
    Navigate to the integrations section of {{APP_NAME}} and click <b>Connect Facebook</b> (or a similarly labeled button).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign in to Facebook">
    A Facebook login window will open. Sign in with your Facebook account (if not already signed in).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and approve permissions">
    Review the permissions requested. Approve access to proceed. You can always manage these permissions later in your Facebook settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete connection">
    Once approved, you'll be redirected back to {{APP_NAME}}. Your Facebook account is now connected!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>Connecting your Facebook account never allows {{APP_NAME}} to post on your behalf without explicit permission.</Tip>

## What permissions are requested, and why?

Depending on the features {{APP_NAME}} supports, you may be asked to grant access to:

<ul>
  <li><b>Email</b>: Provides access to your primary email address. <i>Used for account identification and contact purposes.</i></li>
  <li><b>Public Profile</b>: Accesses basic information like your name and profile picture. <i>Used for personalizing your experience.</i></li>
  <li><b>Friends List</b>: Lets {{APP_NAME}} see your friends who also use the app. <i>Used for collaboration or social features.</i></li>
  <li><b>Your Posts</b>: Reads posts on your timeline, including posts you are tagged in. <i>Enables content import or analytics features.</i></li>
  <li><b>Your Photos</b>: Provides access to photos you’ve uploaded. <i>Used to sync or display your media.</i></li>
  <li><b>Your Likes</b>: Lets {{APP_NAME}} see what pages or content you've liked. <i>Used for interest-based features or analytics.</i></li>
  <li><b>Status Updates</b>: Reads your Facebook status updates. <i>Supports status tracking or analytics.</i></li>
  <li><b>Your Events</b>: Accesses events you are attending or hosting. <i>Used for calendar syncing or reminders.</i></li>
  <li><b>Manage Pages</b>: Allows {{APP_NAME}} to manage Facebook Pages you administer. <i>Required for posting or analytics on managed Pages. You must be a Page admin.</i></li>
  <li><b>Publish to Groups</b>: Permits posting content to Facebook Groups you belong to. <i>Needed only if {{APP_NAME}} offers group publishing features.</i></li>
</ul>

<Info>You may not be asked for all permissions—just those required for the features you use in {{APP_NAME}}.</Info>

## How do I know it's working?

After connecting, you should see your Facebook account listed as "Connected" under Linked Accounts in {{APP_NAME}}. Some apps may also display your imported photos, posts, or events.

## Troubleshooting & common issues

<Warning>If you deny any requested permissions, certain features in {{APP_NAME}} may not work or may be limited.</Warning>

- **Wrong Facebook account?**
  - Make sure you are logged into the correct Facebook account in your browser before you start the connection process.
- **Missing access to pages/groups?**
  - You must be an admin or member of the relevant Facebook Page or Group for those permissions to work.
- **Accidentally denied a permission?**
  - Disconnect and reconnect your account, reviewing and approving all requested permissions.
- **Connection suddenly stopped working?**
  - Check if the integration has been removed in your Facebook <b>Settings & Privacy → Settings → Apps and Websites</b>.
  - Reconnect your account from {{APP_NAME}} if integration was removed or permissions were revoked.
- **Two-factor authentication or verification needed?**
  - Facebook may prompt for additional verification steps for some accounts. Complete them as requested.

<Tip>If you continue to experience issues, try disconnecting and reconnecting your account. For persistent problems, contact {{APP_NAME}} support.</Tip>

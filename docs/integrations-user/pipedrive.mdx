## Permissions Explained

When you connect Pipedrive, you’ll be asked to grant the following permissions:

| Permission               | Why It's Needed                                                                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Info (base)**    | To identify your account and link Pipedrive to [CustomerAppName].                                    |
| **Contacts: Read**       | To view your contacts, so you can import people and organizations into [CustomerAppName].           |
| **Contacts: Write**      | To let you create or update contacts from [CustomerAppName].                                        |
| **Deals: Read**          | To access your deals and sync pipeline data.                                                        |
| **Deals: Write**         | To allow you to create or update deals directly from [CustomerAppName].                             |
| **Users: Read**          | To synchronize user/team information for proper data assignment.                                    |
| **Admin**                | For advanced features, e.g., managing organization-level settings from [CustomerAppName] (if asked).|

You are always in control. [CustomerAppName] will never modify or delete your Pipedrive data unless you specifically approve actions that require those permissions.

## How to Verify Your Connection

- After connecting, the Pipedrive integration should show as "Connected" in your integrations list.
- You can test the integration by viewing your contacts, deals, or organizations in [CustomerAppName]. Imported records should appear or sync automatically.
- If you make updates in [CustomerAppName], check your Pipedrive account to ensure changes are reflected.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

**1. Login or Authorization Fails**
  - Double-check you used the correct Pipedrive login.
  - Ensure you approved all requested permissions.

**2. Connection Not Showing as "Connected"**
  - Refresh your integrations page.
  - Try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration.

**3. Missing Data**
  - Only data you grant access for will sync. Ensure the correct permissions are enabled at the Pipedrive consent screen.
  - Confirm you have access to the items in Pipedrive (e.g., contacts or deals).

**4. Revoked or Expired Connection**
  - If your connection expires or was revoked, re-connect via the Integrations section using the same steps above.

If you continue to have trouble, reach out to [CustomerAppName] support for assistance.

# Connect Your Xero Account

Integrating your Xero account allows you to sync accounting data seamlessly with your app. Follow the guide below for secure, step-by-step connection and troubleshooting help.

## How to Connect

1. **Start Integration**: Navigate to the app's integration settings and select **Connect Xero** or **Add Xero Account**.
2. **Sign In to Xero**: Click the link or button to sign in with your Xero credentials. You’ll be redirected to the secure Xero login page.
3. **Grant Permissions**: Review the permissions requested, then authorize access. This is required to enable the integration (see [What permissions are requested?](#what-permissions-are-requested)).
4. **Return to the App**: Once authorization is complete, you'll be automatically redirected back.
5. **Connection Complete**: Your Xero account is now connected! You should see a confirmation or your Xero data available within the app.

## What permissions are requested?

To deliver a seamless experience, the integration requests the following from Xero:

- **offline_access**: Allows your app to securely refresh its connection to Xero, so you don't have to reauthorize frequently. This means ongoing access to your data without repeated logins.
- **openid**: Used only to verify your identity—this allows secure authentication and retrieval of your Xero user ID. No other personal or company data is accessed by this permission alone.

## How to Test Your Connection

After connecting, you can verify that Xero data is syncing correctly:

1. Check the integrations dashboard for a status indicator or last sync time next to Xero.
2. Look for Xero data (such as accounts or transactions) in the relevant section of your app.

If you do not see any data or encounter a message about incomplete setup, you may need to reconnect or repeat authorization.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

**1. Authorization denied or canceled**
   - Ensure you allow the requested permissions during the Xero authorization process.
   - If you accidentally denied access, restart the connection process from your app’s integrations page.

**2. Incorrect credentials**
   - Verify you are signing in to Xero with the correct username and password.
   - If needed, reset your Xero password at the Xero login page.

**3. Data not syncing or missing**
   - Check that the connection is marked as active in your app’s integration settings.
   - Try refreshing the integration or reconnecting your Xero account.
   - There may be a short delay after initial connection—wait a few minutes and try again.

**4. Lost connection/re-authentication required**
   - For security, Xero may require re-authentication after certain periods. Simply follow the connect steps above to renew access.

If problems persist, contact your support team using the help or support menu in your app.

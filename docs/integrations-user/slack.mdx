## What Permissions Are Requested, and Why?

To function properly, the integration requests the following permissions in Slack. Here’s what each permission allows and why it’s needed:

| Permission              | Why it’s Needed |
|-------------------------|:----------------|
| View app mentions       | Needed to see when you mention the app, allowing automated responses or workflows. |
| Access channel info     | To find and display public Slack channels, and let you select where to send or receive information. |
| View messages in channels | Lets the app read conversations so it can sync or display relevant information. |
| Manage channels         | Allows creation/renaming/archiving public channels (if the app supports channel management features). |
| Post messages           | Lets the app send messages, alerts, or updates to your channels and conversations. |
| Use slash commands      | Enables custom slash commands you can use in Slack. |
| View direct messages    | Needed if the app supports pulling or syncing messages from private/direct conversations. |
| Start direct messages   | Allows the app to begin direct message conversations with users (for alerts, notifications, etc). |
| View user info          | To show Slack user names, emails, or avatars inside the app. |
| View user emails        | Used for displaying or syncing your Slack email address (never shared outside the app). |
| View user profile fields| Displays additional profile info (like display name or team role) as relevant in features. |
| Administer workspace    | (If requested) Needed to manage Slack workspace settings from within the app (admin access required). |
| View files              | Lets the app read files shared in your Slack, if it supports file sync or previews. |
| Manage files            | Allows file upload, edit, or deletion as needed by the integration features. |

## How to Test Your Slack Connection

After connecting, you can check that Slack and your app are linked:

- Look for a confirmation or success message in your app’s integration page.
- Test sending a message or using a Slack-related function (like posting to a channel, or running a slash command from Slack). 
- You should see updates both in your app and the selected Slack workspace.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

**Issue:** You’re not seeing your expected Slack workspace or channels.  
**Resolution:** Try disconnecting and reconnecting, ensuring you select the correct Slack workspace.

**Issue:** “Permission denied” error during connection.  
**Resolution:** Make sure you have sufficient permissions for that Slack workspace, or contact a workspace admin for help.

**Issue:** Messages or actions do not appear in Slack after connecting.
**Resolution:** Double-check the permissions granted. Re-connect if needed. Sometimes it can take a minute for changes to take effect.

**Note:** Still having trouble? Reach out to customer support for assistance. (They can’t see your Slack messages, files, or data beyond the permissions you approve.)

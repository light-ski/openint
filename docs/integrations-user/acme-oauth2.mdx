# Connect Acme OAuth

Easily connect your Acme account to this app to unlock new features, such as sharing your social profile or managing posts directly from within the application.

## Quickstart Guide

Follow these steps to securely link your Acme account:

1. **Go to Integrations:** In your account settings, find the "Integrations" or "Connected Accounts" section.
2. **Choose Acme OAuth:** Click the option to connect Acme.
3. **Authorize Access:** You’ll be redirected to Acme’s secure login page. Log in with your Acme account.
4. **Grant Permissions:** Review the requested permissions and confirm access. You will be returned automatically once authorization is complete.

Once these steps are finished, your account will be connected.

## Permissions Requested

Connecting your Acme account requires your permission for these features:

- **Read your profile information**: Allows the app to access your name and profile details.
- **Manage your posts**: Lets the app view and manage (create, edit, or delete) your social posts on your behalf.

These permissions enable the app to personalize your experience and seamlessly sync your social activity.

## How to Tell if It Worked

After connecting, you should see your Acme profile details or posts appear within the app. If you can view and manage your content from here, the integration is active.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

Most users connect successfully, but here are solutions for frequent problems:

- **Login failed:** Double-check your Acme username and password. Try again if you see a login error.
- **Permission denied:** Make sure you grant all required permissions. The integration won’t work if you skip any.
- **Returned to the app too soon:** Some browsers block pop-ups—disable blockers or try a different browser.
- **Connection incomplete:** If the connection seems stuck, refresh the app and retry connecting.

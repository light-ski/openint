# Connect your Jira account

Easily link your Jira account to this app so you can view, create, and manage your Jira issues and projects directly. Connecting your account is secure and only takes a minute.

## Prerequisites

- You have an active Jira account (Atlassian account)
- You have permission to access the relevant projects in Jira

## How to connect

Follow these steps to connect your Jira account:

1. Inside the app, go to the Integrations or Connections page.
2. Find the **Jira** integration and click **Connect**.
3. You will be redirected to Atlassian’s secure login page. Log in with your Jira (Atlassian) credentials if prompted.
4. Review the permissions requested. Click **Allow** to grant access.
5. You’ll be automatically redirected back to the app. You should see a success message or your Jira data appear.

## Permissions requested

When connecting your Jira account, the following permissions are requested. These are needed to let the app function correctly:

- **Read user profile information** (`read:jira-user`):
  - Access your name, email, and avatar to personalize your app experience.
- **Read Jira issues and projects** (`read:jira-work`):
  - Import and show your Jira tickets, projects, and boards inside the app.
- **Create and update Jira issues** (`write:jira-work`):
  - Let you create or make changes to Jira issues directly from this app.
- **Manage Jira project settings** (`manage:jira-project`):
  - Control project-level features where needed (like app integrations or workflows).
- **Modify global Jira configurations** (`manage:jira-configuration`):
  - Required for some advanced workspace-wide setup and integrations.
- **Offline access** (`offline_access`):
  - Let the connection stay active, syncing your Jira data in the background even if you aren't signed in to the app.

## How to confirm your connection works

- After connecting, you should see some Jira data inside this app (e.g., a list of issues, projects, or boards).
- Try creating or updating a Jira issue from within the app to verify.

If you see any error notice, see the troubleshooting section below.

## Troubleshooting & common issues

**I can’t log in to Jira**

- Double-check your Jira (Atlassian) credentials.
- Make sure your Jira account is active and has the necessary access.

**Access denied / Consent refused**

- If you click "Deny" on the permission screen, the connection won't be established. Restart the connection process and click "Allow." 
- Your Jira admin may have restricted permissions. Contact your Jira administrator if you are unable to grant access.

**I don’t see my projects or issues after connecting**

- You might not have the required permissions in Jira for those projects.
- Refresh the page.
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration.

**Authorization expired or revoked**

- If you disconnect Jira from your Atlassian security settings or change your password, you may need to re-connect here.
- Go through the connection process again to restore access.

**Other issues?**

- If the problem persists, please contact your workspace admin or reach out to customer support for your app.

# Connect Your Gong Account

Easily link your Gong account to {{customerAppName}} to automatically sync call recordings, analytics, conversations, and more.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to connect your Gong account:

1. **Find the Gong Integration**
   - Go to the Integrations or Connections section of your {{customerAppName}} dashboard.
   - Select **Gong** from the list of available integrations.

2. **Start the Connection**
   - Click **Connect Gong** (or similar button).
   - A new window will open, taking you to the Gong login page.

3. **Log in and Approve Access**
   - Log in to your Gong account (if not already signed in).
   - Review the permissions requested.
   - Click **Allow** or **Approve** to grant access.

4. **Return to {{customerAppName}}**
   - Once approved, you'll be brought back to {{customerAppName}}.
   - The integration status should show as **Connected**.

## Permissions Requested

When connecting Gong, you will be asked to approve the following permissions:

| Permission          | Why It’s Needed                                              |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| User Profile Access | To read your basic Gong profile for identification.          |
| Calls Access        | To sync and display your call recordings and metadata.       |
| Analytics Access    | To display and analyze performance data from Gong.           |
| Admin Permissions   | For managing users/settings if your workflow requires this.  |
| Conversations Access| To access, sync, and comment on conversations/transcripts.   |

{{customerAppName}} will only use these permissions to help you get the most from the Gong integration.

## How to Confirm the Connection

- After approving access, return to your dashboard and check the Gong integration status.
- You should see a “Connected” message and may begin seeing Gong data (such as calls or analytics) populate in the app shortly.
- If nothing appears after several minutes, try refreshing the page or following the troubleshooting steps below.

## Troubleshooting

Having trouble? Here are some common issues and fixes:

- **Cancelled Connection**: If you closed the Gong window or clicked "Deny", restart the connection process.
- **Insufficient Permissions**: If access was denied, make sure you are an admin in your Gong account, and grant all requested permissions.
- **Pop-up Blockers**: Check if your browser is blocking pop-up windows and allow them for {{customerAppName}}.
- **Session Expired**: If redirected to a blank or error page, reload and try again.
- **Already Connected Elsewhere**: If asked to disconnect an existing integration, follow the prompts or contact your admin.

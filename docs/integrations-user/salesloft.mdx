4. **Confirm and finish:**
   - Click **Allow** to grant access.
   - You will be redirected back, and the connection will be established.

## Permissions Requested

When you connect your Salesloft account, the following access is requested:

- **View your user profile** (`users:read`):
  - Lets the app read your name, email, and role—only for displaying your account info within the app.
- **Read calls** (`calls:read`):
  - Allows the app to display your call recordings, transcripts, and related info. Cannot make or edit calls.
- **Read emails** (`emails:read`):
  - Lets the app show your sent emails and email templates. Cannot send or modify emails.
- **View contacts/leads** (`people:read`):
  - Used to read your contact and lead details for better context or syncing. Does not allow editing or creating contacts.
- **View sales cadences** (`cadences:read`):
  - Provides access to your sales workflows and sequences for display or planning purposes only.
- **Manage activities** (`activities:write`):
  - Lets the app log or update your activities (calls, emails, meetings) automatically in Salesloft, helping keep records up to date.
- **Manage contacts/leads** (`people:write`):
  - Allows the app to create, edit, or delete contacts/leads on your behalf. This is only used if you choose to sync records bi-directionally.
- **Admin access** (`admin`):
  - Grants full administrative permissions, including user management and settings. This will only be requested if your workflow requires admin-level operations.

You are always in control—only grant permissions you’re comfortable with.

## How to Confirm the Connection Works

Once connected:

- You should see Salesloft listed as “Connected” in the Integrations section.
- Try viewing or syncing data (such as contacts or activities) from Salesloft within the app.
- If the integration is successful, your data will appear and update as expected.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

- **Authentication failed or timed out:**
  - Make sure your Salesloft credentials are correct and that you completed all steps in a single session.
- **Permissions error:**
  - Some features may not work if you did not grant all required permissions. If needed, disconnect and reconnect, ensuring the app requests all required permissions.
- **Stale data or information not syncing:**
  - Try disconnecting and reconnecting Salesloft. Refresh your browser after reconnecting.
- **Pop-up blockers:**
  - If the Salesloft sign-in window does not open, disable browser pop-up blockers and try again.

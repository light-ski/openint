# Connect your Twitter account

You can securely connect your Twitter account with [YourApp] to unlock features that integrate your social presence—such as viewing and posting content, syncing Twitter data, or enabling scheduled actions. Connecting is simple and safe, and you can control what permissions are granted at any time.

## How to connect your Twitter account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the connection process">
    In [YourApp], navigate to the Integrations or Connected Accounts page and click <b>Connect Twitter</b>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize access with Twitter">
    A Twitter window will open. Login if prompted, then review the requested permissions.<br/><br/>
    Click <b>Authorize</b> (or "Allow") to grant permission. You may be asked to confirm your Twitter account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the connection">
    After authorizing, you’ll be redirected back to [YourApp].
    You should see Twitter listed as a connected account or receive a confirmation message.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions explained

When connecting, [YourApp] will request the following permission from your Twitter account:

- **offline.access** – <i>This allows [YourApp] to stay connected to your Twitter account, so it can sync and update data even when you’re not actively using the app. No actions are performed on your behalf without your explicit direction.</i>

<Info>
You can disconnect [YourApp] from your Twitter account at any time from the integrations settings in [YourApp] or from your Twitter account settings. Revoking access may pause or stop features that depend on Twitter data.
</Info>

## How to confirm your account is connected

- Twitter should appear as “Connected” or “Linked” in your [YourApp] integrations section.
- Features that depend on Twitter (like posting, data sync, or analytics) should now become available.

If you don’t see Twitter as connected, try refreshing the page or repeating the connection steps above.

## Troubleshooting

<Tip>
If you accidentally authorized the wrong Twitter account, disconnect in [YourApp] and repeat the connection process. Make sure you are logged into the correct Twitter account in your browser before starting.
</Tip>

<Warning>
If you deny permissions during setup, [YourApp] will not be able to connect. You’ll need to restart the connection process and grant the requested access.
</Warning>

- If you revoked [YourApp]’s access from Twitter settings, return to [YourApp] and reconnect Twitter to restore functionality.
- If your Twitter session expires or integration is interrupted, simply reconnect via [YourApp]’s integration settings page.

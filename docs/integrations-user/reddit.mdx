# Connect Reddit to Your App

You can securely connect your Reddit account to this app, letting you access Reddit features directly from your dashboard. This guide walks you through the authentication process, explains requested permissions, and helps you resolve common issues.

## Quickstart: How to Connect
1. **Start the connection**: In the app dashboard, look for the option to connect your Reddit account (usually found under settings or integrations).
2. **Login with Reddit**: Click the "Connect Reddit" button. You’ll be redirected to Reddit’s secure login page.
3. **Review permissions**: Reddit will show you a list of requested permissions the app needs (details below). Review and approve to continue.
4. **Grant access**: Click "Allow" to complete the connection. You will be redirected back to the app once authorization is successful.
5. **Ready to go**: The app will now be able to access Reddit features on your behalf.

## How Do I Know It Worked?
- After connecting, you should see a confirmation inside the app (your Reddit username, or Reddit-related features become enabled).
- Try to use a Reddit-powered feature (like viewing posts, saving links, or submitting a comment) to confirm everything works.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

**Problem:** You see an error about denied permissions or failed login.
> Solution: Make sure you approve all the requested permissions. If you accidentally denied access, try reconnecting.

**Problem:** Connected the wrong Reddit account.
> Solution: Disconnect from the app (see below) and reconnect using the correct Reddit account credentials.

**Problem:** You don’t see Reddit features after connecting.
> Solution: Try refreshing the app or logging out and back in. If issues persist, disconnect and reconnect Reddit.

**Problem:** You want to disconnect Reddit.
> Solution: In the app, go to the integrations or account page, and choose the option to disconnect Reddit. You can also revoke access directly from [Reddit’s authorized applications page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).

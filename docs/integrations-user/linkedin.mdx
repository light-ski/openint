# Connect LinkedIn

Connect your LinkedIn account to your [App] to unlock seamless features such as importing your profile information, sharing posts, and engaging with your professional network directly from the platform.

## How to Connect Your LinkedIn Account

1. Go to the LinkedIn integration section in your [App].
2. Click **Connect LinkedIn**. You’ll be redirected to LinkedIn’s secure login and authorization page.
3. Sign in to your LinkedIn account if prompted.
4. Review the permissions requested and select **Allow** to proceed.
5. Once authorized, you’ll be returned to [App] and your LinkedIn account will be connected.

## Permissions Requested

When connecting LinkedIn, [App] may ask for one or more of the following permissions depending on which features you use:

- **profile**: Access to your basic profile (name, photo, headline, positions)
- **openid**: Used to verify your LinkedIn identity and keep your account secure
- **r_basicprofile**: Access to your extended profile (experience, education, skills, recommendations)
- **email**: Access to your primary email address on LinkedIn
- **w_member_social**: Ability to post, comment, and like on your behalf
- **rw_organization_admin**: Manage or update organization/company pages you administer
- **r_organization_social**: Read organization posts and stats for organizations you have access to
- **r_ads**: Access advertising account, campaign, and analytics information
- **w_organization_social**: Post and engage as your organization

You will always see the exact permissions requested before completing the connection. Only the permissions needed for features you use will be requested.

## Testing Your Connection

After connecting, you should see LinkedIn marked as "Connected" in your [App]. To ensure it’s working, try importing your profile, syncing data, or using any LinkedIn-enabled features in the app.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

- **Access denied or permissions not granted:** If you skip or deny requested permissions, the LinkedIn integration may not work as expected. Disconnect and try connecting again, granting all required access.
- **Wrong LinkedIn account:** Make sure the LinkedIn account you connect is the one you want to use with [App]. If not, log out of LinkedIn and reconnect with the correct account.
- **Redirect or sign-in errors:** Refresh your browser, clear your cookies, or close and reopen the app, then try connecting again. Occasionally, an expired session can cause issues.
- **Changed permissions after connecting:** If you alter permissions from your LinkedIn settings, you may need to disconnect and reconnect LinkedIn in [App].
- **Persistent issues:** If you continue having trouble, reach out to [App] support for help.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

- <b>Denied Permissions:</b> If you deny any permissions, the connection cannot complete. Try again and approve the requested permissions.
- <b>Popup Blocked:</b> If nothing happens when you click Connect, enable popups for this site in your browser.
- <b>Wrong Intercom Account:</b> Double-check you logged into the correct Intercom workspace.
- <b>Missing Permissions:</b> You may need admin access on Intercom to grant all requested permissions.
- <b>Connection Failed:</b> If sync does not work, disconnect and try again, or contact support.

We use Intercom's secure sign-in process. Your password is never shared with our app, and you can disconnect at any time.

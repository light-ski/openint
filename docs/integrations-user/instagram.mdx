# Connect Your Instagram Account

You can connect your Instagram account to this app in just a few minutes, enabling you to sync posts, manage comments, and access business insights directly from your dashboard. Follow the guide below to get started.

## Quickstart

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** or **Connections** page in your app dashboard.
2. Click **Connect Instagram**.
3. You will be redirected to Instagram to authorize the connection. If prompted, log in to your Instagram account.
4. Review the permissions requested and click **Allow** to grant access.
5. Once complete, you will be returned to your app and your Instagram account should now be connected.

## Permissions Requested

When connecting, the following permissions may be requested in order to unlock all integration features:

- **Profile Information**: Access your Instagram username, profile picture, and account type.
- **Photos & Videos**: View and sync your Instagram photos and videos, including their captions and comments.
- **Pages Management**: Access a list of Instagram Pages you manage (required for business or creator accounts).
- **Publish Content**: Allow the app to publish posts (photos and videos) on your behalf.
- **Manage Comments**: Read and respond to comments on your Instagram posts directly from your app.
- **Insights & Analytics**: View engagement metrics and business insights tied to your Instagram account.
- **Ads Management**: Manage your Instagram ads and advertising campaigns if your account is eligible.

> **Note:** You can review or revoke these permissions at any time from your Instagram account settings.

## How to Verify Your Connection

After connecting:

- You should see your Instagram username or profile.
- Recent posts and media should appear in your appâ€™s dashboard or integration area.
- You may receive an in-app or email confirmation of a successful connection.

If you do not see your content within a few minutes, try refreshing the page or re-authenticating via the integration settings.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and how to resolve them:

### Not all permissions granted
Make sure to accept all requested permissions on the Instagram authorization screen. Missing permissions may limit available features (e.g., not seeing all posts or not being able to publish content).

### Logged in with the wrong Instagram account
Log out of Instagram in your browser, then retry the connection. Ensure you login with the correct Instagram account.

### Instagram account is not a business or creator account
Some features (like insights, ads management, publishing) require your Instagram to be a business or creator account. [Learn how to switch to a business account](https://help.instagram.com/502981923235522).

### Session timed out or connection interrupted
If you receive a timeout or error after authentication, repeat the connection process and ensure a stable internet connection.

### Still having trouble?
Check your app dashboard for any integration-specific error messages or contact support for further assistance.

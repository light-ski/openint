# Connecting QuickBooks

Integrate your QuickBooks Online account to sync your business’s accounting, payments, and payroll data with this application. Once connected, you’ll be able to access up-to-date financial information and automate accounting workflows right inside the app—securely and quickly.

## What You’ll Need

- A QuickBooks Online account (admin or user with integration permissions)
- Access to your company’s QuickBooks data

## What Permissions Are Required?

When you connect QuickBooks, you will be asked to grant certain permissions. Here’s what will be requested and why:

| Permission | Why it’s needed |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accounting (full) | Allows managing customers, vendors, invoices, payments, expenses, and all accounting data. |
| Accounting (read-only) | Lets the app view your accounting data without making changes. |
| Payments | Allows viewing and processing payments, required for payment-related features. |
| Payroll | Allows managing payroll data including employees and pay runs. |
| Payroll (read-only) | Lets the app view payroll information without making changes. |
| Sales Receipts | Allows creating and viewing sales receipts from within the app. |
| Basic Info (profile, email, phone, address) | Lets the app display your name and basic company details in the interface, but does NOT access any company data. |

You’ll be able to review these during the connection process.

## How to Connect QuickBooks

1. **Go to Integrations:** In the app, navigate to the settings or integrations page.
2. **Select QuickBooks:** Find QuickBooks in the integrations list and click “Connect” or “Add Account.”
3. **Sign In & Authorize:** A new window will open prompting you to log in to your QuickBooks Online account securely.
4. **Review Permissions:** Review the permissions required and click “Allow” or “Authorize” to proceed.
5. **Select Your Company:** If you manage more than one company, choose the company to connect.
6. **Finish:** You’ll be redirected back to the app and see a confirmation that your QuickBooks account is connected.

## How to Test Your Connection

After connecting, you can verify your connection by:

- Checking that your customers, invoices, or transactions are showing up within the app.
- Creating a test invoice or payment and confirming it appears in both apps.

Depending on your company’s QuickBooks setup and permissions, syncing may take a few moments.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

**Can’t Log In?**
- Double-check your QuickBooks email and password.
- Make sure you’re using a QuickBooks Online account; desktop/enterprise versions aren’t supported.

**Didn’t Grant All Permissions?**
- The app may not be able to sync all your data. To fix this, disconnect and reconnect, making sure to grant all permissions requested during the process.

**Wrong Company Connected?**
- Disconnect your QuickBooks account from the app, then reconnect and select the correct company during authorization.

**Connection Expired or Not Syncing?**
- You may need to re-authorize your QuickBooks account. Disconnect and reconnect via the integrations page.

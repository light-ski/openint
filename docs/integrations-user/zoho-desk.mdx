These permissions allow {ProductName} to sync tickets and contacts, and to display relevant support data from your Zoho Desk account.

## Test Your Connection

Once connected, you should see your Zoho Desk tickets or contacts start appearing in {ProductName}. For a quick test:

1. Navigate to the area in {ProductName} where Zoho Desk data should be displayed.
2. If you do not see your data, try refreshing the page.
3. Optionally, create a new ticket in Zoho Desk and check that it appears in {ProductName} after syncing.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

- **Wrong account or region.** If you see an error after authentication, double-check the Zoho Desk region/domain you selected matches your Zoho account (e.g., `zoho.com`, `zoho.eu`).
- **Authentication failed.** Ensure your Zoho Desk username and password are correct. If you use Single Sign-On (SSO), make sure it’s configured properly.
- **Permission denied.** If you declined any permissions during the connection process, try reconnecting and ensure all requested permissions are granted.
- **No data is syncing.** After connecting, if your tickets or contacts do not appear, try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration. Make sure you have the necessary privileges (admin or integration access) in Zoho Desk.

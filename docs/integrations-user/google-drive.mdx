# Connecting Google Drive to [AppName]

Easily link your Google Drive account to [AppName] so you can view and work with your files directly within the platform.

## How to Connect

1. In [AppName], navigate to the section where you can link a file storage service or select “Connect Google Drive.”
2. Click the “Connect Google Drive” button.
3. You’ll be redirected to a secure Google sign-in page. Select the Google account you wish to use.
4. Review the permissions requested and click **Allow**.
5. After allowing access, you’ll be taken back to [AppName]. The integration is now complete.

## Permissions Requested

When you connect Google Drive, [AppName] requests specific permissions so it can securely access your files and information. These permissions are required for the following features:

| Permission                            | Why It’s Needed                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| View your Google Drive metadata        | To show information about your files and folders (names, locations, etc.).   |
| View your Google Drive files (read-only) | If enabled, to allow reading file contents to display or sync them in-app.     |
| Access files/folders opened or created by [AppName] | To work only with documents you specifically select or create.                  |
| Access application-specific data       | To store app-specific settings or data in Drive, if required by [AppName].    |
| Access your Google Photos in Drive (read-only) | If the app includes features related to Google Photos.                          |
| Access Google Apps Script projects     | If [AppName] interacts with custom scripts stored in your Drive.              |

Depending on your organization's settings, not all permissions above may be required by your workspace. [AppName] will only request the minimum needed.

## How to Verify Your Connection

- After connecting, go to your [AppName] dashboard or integration settings and look for Google Drive listed under Connected Accounts.
- Try viewing, searching, or syncing files from Google Drive to confirm everything is working.

If you encounter issues, try refreshing the integration or reconnecting your account.

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

> **Tip**: If your integration doesn’t work as expected, most issues can be resolved by retrying the connection or checking your Google permissions.

- **Wrong Google Account**: Make sure you select the correct account during sign-in. Disconnect and reconnect if needed.
- **Permission Not Granted**: If you did not grant all requested permissions, integration features may not work. Try reconnecting and approving all requested access.
- **Revoked Permissions**: If you remove [AppName]'s access from your Google Account, reconnect through [AppName] to restore integration.
- **Files Not Showing Up**: [AppName] can only display files you have granted access to. To access more files, you may need to update your permission settings during reconnection.
- **Google Security Checks**: If prompted for additional verification, follow the instructions from Google to continue securely.

If you continue to have trouble, consult [AppName] support for further assistance.

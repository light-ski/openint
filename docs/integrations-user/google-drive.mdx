# Connect Your Google Drive Account

Easily connect your Google Drive with your Company A account to securely sync, view, and manage your files directly from Company A. Connecting your account only takes a few moments and is fully secured using Google’s standard authentication process.

## How to Connect Google Drive

Follow these steps to link your Google Drive:

1. **Navigate to the Integrations or Connections page** in your Company A account.
2. Find **Google Drive** in the list of available integrations and select **Connect** or **Add Account**.
3. You’ll be redirected to sign in with your Google account if you’re not already signed in.
4. Review the permissions requested and click **Allow** to grant access.
5. After authorization, you’ll be redirected back to Company A. That’s it! Your Google Drive is now connected.

## What Permissions Are Requested?

When connecting your account, Company A will request certain permissions so it can function properly with your Google Drive data. You will see these explained during the Google consent screen. Here’s what they mean:

### Requested Permissions

<details>
<summary><strong>View file metadata only (<code>drive.metadata.readonly</code>)</strong></summary>
Allows Company A to view the names, folders, and properties of your Google Drive files, but not the content itself. This is typically used to display your Drive’s folder structure and file lists, without accessing the files themselves.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>View your files (<code>drive.readonly</code>)</strong></summary>
Allows Company A to view the contents and metadata of all the files in your Drive (for example, to preview or search through documents from within Company A). No files can be changed or deleted with this permission.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Edit, upload, and organize files (<code>drive.file</code> or <code>drive</code>)</strong></summary>
Allows Company A to create or edit files on your behalf, or organize folders. Only requested if you opt to enable write/change features.
</details>

You are always in control—only grant the permissions described on the consent screen. Company A requests only the minimal access necessary to provide its features.

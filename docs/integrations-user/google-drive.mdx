# Connect Your Google Drive Account

Easily connect your Google Drive with your Company A account to sync, view, and manage your files—all using Google's secure authentication. The process is quick and your privacy stays in your control.


## How to Connect Google Drive

1. Go to your **Integrations** (or **Connections**) page in Company A.
2. Find **Google Drive** and choose **Connect** or **Add Account**.
3. Sign in with your Google account if prompted.
4. Review the permissions listed on the Google sign-in screen, then click **Allow**.
5. Once authorized, you’ll return to Company A, and your Google Drive integration will be active.


## What Permissions Are Requested?

When connecting Google Drive, Company A typically requests only the most limited access it needs to work with your Drive data. The default permission required is:

<details open>
<summary><strong>View file metadata only (<code>drive.metadata.readonly</code>)</strong></summary>
Allows Company A to see the names, folders, and other properties about your files—but never the file’s actual content. This is used, for example, to display your Drive’s folder structure or list your files and locations.
</details>

If you enable optional features, you may see additional permissions requested. These could include:

<details>
<summary><strong>View file metadata (<code>drive.metadata</code>)</strong></summary>
Allows Company A to see read-only metadata for all the files in your Drive (such as names, locations, and properties), but not file content.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>View all files (<code>drive.readonly</code>)</strong></summary>
Allows Company A to view both the contents and properties of all files in your Drive. No changes can be made to your files with this permission.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Create, edit, or delete all Drive files (<code>drive</code>)</strong></summary>
Allows Company A to read, modify, create, and delete any file and file metadata in your Google Drive, including shared files. This broad permission is only requested if you specifically enable features that require making these types of changes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Create or open files (<code>drive.file</code>)</strong></summary>
Allows Company A access only to files and folders that you have created or opened with the app (or chosen via a file picker). It cannot access existing files unless you select them, and cannot see or change other files in your Drive.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Application-specific Drive data (<code>drive.appdata</code>)</strong></summary>
Permits access to a special app folder in your Drive that stores integration-specific configuration. These files are hidden from you and other apps by default.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>View your Drive photos (<code>drive.photos.readonly</code>)</strong></summary>
Allows Company A to view your Google Photos that are stored in Drive (e.g., for displaying image previews, if supported by the integration).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Manage Google Apps Script projects (<code>drive.scripts</code>)</strong></summary>
Allows Company A to create, access, or run Google Apps Script projects saved in your Drive (relevant only for automations, if supported).
</details>

<Callout type="info">
You’re always in control. Only the permissions described above are requested, and only when necessary for features you've enabled. You can review and approve access during the Google sign-in process, and revoke permissions at any time in your Google Account settings.

# Connect your HubSpot account
You can connect your HubSpot account to this app to easily sync your contacts, companies, tickets, and more directly from HubSpot. Connecting allows seamless data flow—no manual export or import required—so you can automate your workflow and keep everything up-to-date.
## How to connect
1. Go to the **Integrations** or **Connections** section in the app.
2. Click **Connect to HubSpot**.
3. You will be redirected to HubSpot to sign in (if you aren’t already).
4. Review the permissions requested, then click **Allow** to grant access.
5. You’ll be redirected back to the app, and your HubSpot account will be connected.
Your account is now ready! The app will begin syncing your HubSpot data as configured.
## Permissions requested
To enable a seamless experience, the following permissions may be requested:
- **Contacts (Read/Write):** Manage and view your HubSpot contacts.
- **Companies (Read/Write):** Access and update information about companies in your CRM.
- **Deals (Read/Write):** Manage your deals and sales pipeline.
- **Custom Objects (Read/Write):** Work with custom data unique to your organization.
- **Forms (Read/Write):** Access and manage your forms and form submissions.
- **Tickets (Read/Write):** View and update support tickets.
- **Users and Teams (Read/Write):** View or manage users and team settings as needed for syncing assignments or visibility.
- **Content (Read/Write):** Publish and manage blogs, pages, and related content.
- **Files (Read/Write):** Upload and access marketing or sales collateral stored in HubSpot.
- **Automation:** Manage workflows and other automation features.
- **E-commerce:** Access product, order, or line item data tied to e-commerce features.
These permissions are used solely to provide the features you’ve enabled and will never be used for unauthorized actions.
## How to test your connection
- After connecting, check your app’s dashboard or integration status page for a confirmation message.
- Try syncing a contact or company—changes should appear in both the app and HubSpot.
- If you see an error or nothing syncs after a few minutes, see the Troubleshooting section below.
## Troubleshooting & common issues
**Didn’t get redirected back to the app?**
• Make sure you completed the permissions prompt and didn’t close the window early.
**Accidentally denied permissions or want to change them?**
• Disconnect HubSpot in the app and try connecting again. HubSpot will ask for the correct permissions the next time.
**Connected the wrong HubSpot account?**
• Log out of HubSpot in your browser before connecting again, then log in to the correct account during the connection process.
**“Permission denied” or missing data?**
• You may not have the necessary permissions within HubSpot (e.g., you’re not an administrator). Please check with your HubSpot admin or ensure you grant all required access during setup.
**Other issues?**
• Try disconnecting and reconnecting.
• Ensure you’re using the same email address in both the app and HubSpot.
• If problems continue, contact support.

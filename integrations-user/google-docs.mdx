## What Permissions Are Requested?

To work with your Google Docs, we request certain permissions from Google. Below is what each one means:

- **View and manage your Google Docs documents**  
  Needed to create, edit, and sync your documents so Company A’s features work seamlessly.
- **View your Google Docs documents**  
  (Read-only) This lets Company A show your document list or import content, but not make changes.
- **Access specific Google Drive files**  
  Only applies to files you’ve created via Company A or specifically selected for use—no broader access.
- **View all your Google Drive files**  
  (Read-only) To display or import files from your Drive as needed. No files are changed.
- **Full access to all Google Drive files**  
  Required for features that let you update or organize multiple documents and files directly.
- **Access the currently open document**  
  (Session-limited) Sometimes used for quick or optional tasks limited to the doc you’re working on now.

> **Note:** We only request the minimum permissions needed for Company A features to work. You’ll review and approve these in the Google consent screen before anything happens.

## How to Test the Integration

- Look for a “Connected” status next to Google Docs in Company A’s Integrations area.
- Try importing a Google Doc or syncing content. You should be able to see and work with your Google Docs within Company A.
- If your docs appear or sync, your connection is working!

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

- If you accidentally denied access, repeat the steps above to re-connect and approve permissions.
- For “connection expired” messages, you may need to reconnect Google Docs by clicking <strong>Reconnect</strong> (you’ll be prompted if needed).
- If you still have issues, sign out from your Google account in all browser tabs, then repeat the setup steps.

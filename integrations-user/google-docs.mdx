# Connect Google Docs

Easily link your Google Docs account to your Company A account. This allows you to sync, create, and edit documents directly from within Company A, enabling seamless automation across your workflows.

---

## Step 1: Start the Connection

1. Go to the **Integrations** section of your Company A dashboard.
2. Find **Google Docs** and click **Connect**.

You will be redirected to sign in with your Google account.

---

## Step 2: Authorize Access

You’ll see a consent screen from Google. Review the permissions requested and click **Allow**. This securely connects your Google Docs account with Company A.

---

## Step 3: What Permissions Are Requested?

To help Company A work with your documents, we request access to the following Google Docs and Drive permissions:

| Permission | What it Means |
| --- | --- |
| **View and manage your Google Docs documents**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`) | Full read and write access to your Google Docs. Allows viewing, creating, editing, and deleting documents. |
| **View your Google Docs documents**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.readonly`) | View-only access to your Google Docs and their metadata. No modifications allowed. |
| **View and manage Google Drive files and folders that you have opened or created with this app**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`) | Access to the specific Docs files created or explicitly shared with Company A. This does *not* grant access to all Drive files. |
| **View the files in your Google Drive**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`) | Read-only access to all of your Google Drive files, but no changes can be made. |
| **View and manage the files in your Google Drive**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`) | Full read and write access to all your Google Drive files, including Docs. Enables Company A to automate or sync data across your Drive. |
| **Access the currently open Google Docs document**<br />(`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents.currentonly`) | Access to only the currently open Docs document (used in certain situations; most limited permission). |

> **Note:** Company A only uses the permissions necessary to deliver the features you enable. You can revoke access at any time from your Google Account settings.

---

## Step 4: Verify the Connection

After allowing access, you’ll be redirected back to Company A. Once connected, you’ll see Google Docs labeled as **Connected** in your Integrations list.

**To test your connection:**
- Try syncing a document, or
- Check the integrations status for Google Docs in your dashboard.
